# Add FinBERT model via transformers, e.g. ProsusAI/finbert
# We'll need to download spacy models separately, e.g., en_core_web_sm
redisbloom # For ingestion deduplication (replaces redis-py-bloom-filter, depends on redis which is already listed)
lxml[html_clean] # Required by newspaper3k for HTML cleaning 

# For deep learning models used by transformers/spacy
torch # Add PyTorch for NLP model dependencies (CPU version)
