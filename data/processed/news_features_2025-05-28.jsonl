That's the way they go.\"\n\nThe sweeping One Big Beautiful Bill Act is projected to raise the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that conducts economic analysis for Congress. The deficit is on track in 2025 to run close to $2 trillion, with the national debt now at $36.2 trillion.\n\n\"I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful, but I don't know if it could be both,\" Musk said in the CBS clip.\n\nTrump and congressional Republicans counter that the bill reduces spending in key areas and will generate enough growth to compensate for the tax reductions. The legislation, though, is expected to face strong resistance in the Senate.\n\nFor his part, Musk has pulled back his DOGE work, saying he plans to focus on running his companies, which include X, Tesla and SpaceX. Musk had been a frequent presence in the White House since Trump's election.\n\n\"DOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything,\" Musk said in an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post. \"So, like, something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Wednesday praised DOGE and Musk's work.\n\n\"The House is eager and ready to act on DOGE's findings so we can deliver even more cuts to big government that President [Donald] Trump wants and the American people demand,\" Johnson wrote in a post on X.\n\nBefore the House can vote to approve the cuts, however, the White House needs to formally request permission to cancel some of the money that Congress set out for specific programs.\n\n\"When the White House sends its rescissions package to the House, we will act quickly by passing legislation to codify the cuts,\" said Johnson, using the term for White House requests not to spend money that Congress authorized.\n\nDespite Johnson's upbeat tone, many of Musk and DOGE's drastic cuts to government grant programs and the federal workforce have been met with resistance in Congress, including from Republicans whose districts have been hit by the cuts and mass layoffs.\n\nDOGE says it has saved $170 billion in taxpayer money since it began in January by targeting waste and redundancy in government.\n\nBut what counts as wasteful spending has proven to be a deeply divisive question.\n\nIn February and March alone, DOGE-related moves were responsible for some 275,000 government layoffs, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a consultancy firm.\n\nMusk's work with Trump, and his frequently incendiary political rhetoric, have also inspired a backlash and widespread protests against his autos business, Tesla .\n\n\"People were burning Teslas. Why would you do that?

In a post last week, Trump said discussions with the EU were \"going nowhere.\"\n\nHowever, sentiment turned positive on Tuesday amid hopes of a breakthrough. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X over the weekend that the EU was \"ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,\" while European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said Monday that he had \"good calls\" with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nEurope's regional Stoxx 600 index slightly extended gains after Trump's comments on Tuesday, last trading up 0.55% on the previous session, while U.S. markets opened broadly higher.\n\nThe 27-member alliance was hit with a 20% tariff on April 2 as part of Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariff strategy, which was then cut for almost all trading partners to 10% for 90 days.

These factors can help explain why closely followed consumer sentiment data compiled by the University of Michigan has been hitting some of its lowest levels in its seven-decade history in the past two months.\n\n\"You have a number of these pressure points rising,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. \"Perhaps in aggregate, it's enough to quash some of these spending numbers.\"\n\nBank of America said this push to collect could particularly weigh on groups that are on more precarious financial footing. \"We believe resumption of student loan payments will have knock-on effects on broader consumer finances, most especially for the subprime consumer segment,\" Bank of America analyst Mihir Bhatia wrote to clients.", "publish_ts": 1747353600000, "source": "CNBC Economy", "entity_id": "the U.S. Department of Education's", "sent_pos": 0.014910402707755566, "sent_neg": 0.9634572267532349, "ner_org": ["the U.S. Department of Education's", "JPMorgan", "Murat Tasci", "Cleveland Federal Reserve", "Trump", "the University of Michigan", "LPL Financial", "Bank of America", "Bank of America"], "ner_gpe": ["U.S."], "ner": ["the U.S. Department of Education's", "JPMorgan", "U.S."], "topics": ["and", "the", "that", "student", "income"], "_debug_sentiment_label": "negative", "_debug_ner_all": [{"text": "the U.S. Department of Education's", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "billions of dollars", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "Americans", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "Donald Trump", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "this month", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "first", "label": "ORDINAL"}, {"text": "around five years", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "JPMorgan", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "between $3.1 billion and $8.5 billion", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "Murat Tasci", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Cleveland Federal Reserve", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "one quarter", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "between 0.7% and 1.8%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "year-over-year", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Trump", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "years", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the University of Michigan", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "seven-decade", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the past two months", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Jeffrey Roach", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "LPL Financial", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Bank of America", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Bank of America", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Mihir Bhatia", "label": "PERSON"}], "relevance_label": "non_relevant", "relevance_score": 0.3}

The U.S. imported nearly $440 billion in goods from China in 2024, running a $295.4 billion trade deficit.\n\n\"We do not want a generalized decoupling from China,\" he said during an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"But what we do want is a decoupling for strategic necessities, which we were unable to obtain during Covid and we realized that efficient supply chains were not resilient supply chains.\"\n\nWhen the pandemic struck in 2020, demand in the U.S. shifted from one reliant more on services to a greater focus on goods. That meant greater difficulty in obtaining material for multiple products including big-ticket appliances and automobiles. The technology industry, with its reliance on semiconductors, was also hit. What followed was an inflation surge in the U.S. not seen in more than 40 years.\n\nThe details of the U.S.-China pact are still sketchy, but U.S. officials have said so-called reciprocal tariffs will be suspended though broad-based 10% duties will remain in effect.\n\n\"We are going to create our own steel.

And for this, we need speed. We need speed and investments, and we need private capital,\" Reiche told CNBC's Annette Weisbach on the sidelines of the Tegernsee summit. While 10% of investments could be taken care of with public money, the remaining 90% relied on the private sector, she said. The newly minted economy minister also addressed regulation coming from Brussels, warning that it could hinder companies from investments and start-ups from growing if it is too restrictive. Germany has had to learn that investments comes with risks \"and we have to kind of be open for taking more risks,\" she said.\n\nwatch now\n\nInitiating regulatory changes will in fact be one of the most important jobs for the new German government, Veronika Grimm, member of the German Council of Economic Experts, told CNBC on the sidelines of the Tegernsee summit. \"It will be important to adjust regulation, so removing or changing innovation-stifling regulation so that more is possible again in many areas of technology,\" she said in comments translated by CNBC. \"And then of course it is about improving the environment or businesses, making it more attractive so that we are competitive again,\" Grimm said.\n\nOn the edge of recession\n\nGermany's economy contracted slightly on an annual basis in both 2023 and 2024 and the quarterly gross domestic product has been flipping between growth and contraction for over two years now, just about managing to avoid a technical recession. Preliminary data for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 0.2% expansion. Forecasts do not suggest much of a reprieve from the sluggishness, with the now former German government last month saying it still expects the economy to stagnate this year. \"This country needs an economic turnaround. After two years of recessions the previous government had to announce again [a] zero growth year for 2025 and we really have to work on this. So on the top of the agenda is an investor booster,\" economy minister Reiche said. Lowering energy prices, stabilizing the security of energy supply and reducing bureaucracy were among the key points on the agenda, she added. This is despite a major fiscal U-turn announced earlier this year, which included changes to the country's long-standing debt rules to allow for additional defense spending and a 500-billion-euro ($562.4 billion) infrastructure package. Several of Germany's key industries are under pressure. The auto industry for example is dealing with stark competition from China and now faces tariffs, while issues in housebuilding and infrastructure have been linked to higher costs and bureaucratic hurdles.

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/gdp-q1-2025-.html", "title": "U.S. economy shrank 0.3% in the first quarter as Trump policy uncertainty weighed on businesses", "body": "watch now\n\nThe U.S. economy contracted in the first three months of 2025 on an import surge at the start of President Donald Trump's second term in office as he wages a potentially costly trade war. Gross domestic product, a sum of all the goods and services produced from January through March, fell at a 0.3% annualized pace, according to a Commerce Department report Wednesday adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation. This was the first quarter of negative growth since Q1 of 2022. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a gain of 0.4% after GDP rose by 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. However, over the past day or so some Wall Street economists changed their outlook to negative growth, largely because of an unexpected rise in imports as companies and consumers sought to get ahead of the Trump tariffs implemented in early April. Indeed, imports soared 41.3% for the quarter, driven by a 50.9% increase in goods, for the biggest growth outside the Covid pandemic since 1974. Imports subtract from GDP, so the contraction in growth may not be viewed as negatively given the potential for the trend to reverse in subsequent quarters. Imports took more than 5 percentage points off the headline reading. Exports rose 1.8%. A slowdown in consumer spending and a sharp decline in federal outlays also contributed to the weak GDP number amid Elon Musk's efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency. \"Maybe some of this negativity is due to a rush to bring in imports before the tariffs go up, but there is simply no way for policy advisors to sugar-coat this. Growth has simply vanished,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds.\n\nPeople shop in a Manhattan store on July 27, 2023 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nConsumer spending slowed during the period but was still positive. Personal consumption expenditures increased 1.8% for the period, the slowest quarterly gain since Q2 of 2023 and down from a 4% gain in the prior quarter. However, a separate report showed that spending was up 0.7% in March, higher than the 0.5% estimate. Moreover, private domestic investment soared during the period, rising 21.9%, primarily driven by a 22.5% surge in equipment spending that also could have been tariff driven. Federal government expenditures declined 5.1% for the quarter, shaving about one-third of a percentage point off GDP. The report comes ahead of the next uncertain steps for Trump's trade policy. In early April, the president announced 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. trade partners as well as a menu of select \"reciprocal\" duties against dozens of nations. On April 9, Trump suspended those duties for a 90-day negotiation period that has yet to yield results, though administration officials have indicated that some deals are near. \"No surprise that GDP took a hit in the first quarter, mainly because the balance of trade blew up as companies imported goods like crazy to front-run tariffs. The more telling number for the future of the expansion was consumer spending, and it grew, but at a relatively weak pace,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. \"That's concerning, but not alarming as it could have been due to bad weather and a spending surge at the end of last year.\" Stock market futures slipped following the report while Treasury yields moved higher. In a Truth Social post following the report, Trump did not address GDP specifically, instead referring to \"Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's.\" \"Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers,\" Trump wrote. \"Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden 'Overhang.' This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other.

Photo by Hannes P Albert/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nGerman consumer inflation came in at 2.2% in April on an annual basis, easing slightly from March levels but coming in above expectations, preliminary data showed Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had estimated a 2.1% reading. The country's consumer price index, harmonized for comparability across the euro zone, had come in at 2.3% in March on an annual basis. So-called core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, accelerated to 2.9% in April from 2.6% in March. The closely-watched services print also jumped to 3.9%, after a 3.5% reading in the previous month. Energy prices meanwhile dropped sharply, falling by 5.4% according to the statistics office. While the inflation rate closing in on the European Central Bank's 2% mark is good news for consumers at first glance, there are some less positive points about the data on closer look, Sebastian Becker, economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note Wednesday. The slight decrease of the headline figures only took place due to lower energy and food costs, he said. \"In comparison, the core inflation rate, which is more important for the ECB ... rose notably again.\" And services inflation appears \"considerably more stubborn than expected,\" Becker added.\n\nEconomic growth\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, preliminary data showed that Germany's economy expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter from the previous three-month period. The figure, released by the German federal statistics office, is adjusted for price, calendar and seasonal variations. The gross domestic product reading was in line with estimates from economists polled by Reuters. Germany's gross domestic had contracted by 0.2% in the fourth quarter. The statistics office attributed the quarterly increase to the fact \"that both household final consumption expenditure and capital formation were higher than in the previous quarter.\" While acknowledging Wednesday's figures were positive, \"the quarterly increase is still far too small to end the country's long-lasting stagnation,\" Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, said in a note. Europe's largest economy has long been sluggish, with its GDP flip-flopping between growth and contraction in each quarter throughout 2023 and 2024. The country has so far avoided technical recession, which is defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction. Key sectors of the economy, such as autos, have been suffering from stronger competition from China. Other industries including housebuilding and infrastructure have also been going through trying times that have been linked to higher costs, muted investment and bureaucratic hurdles. Separately, U.S President Donald Trump's tariff policies have thrust uncertainty onto export reliant Germany which counts the U.S. as its most important trading partner. As part of the European Union, Germany is facing 20% blanket tariffs on goods exported to the U.S., although these levies have been temporarily reduced to 10% to allow time for negotiations. U.S. duties on steel, aluminum and autos also affect the country. The German government last week cut its economic outlook to predict stagnation in 2025, with outgoing economy minister Robert Habeck saying Trump's trade policies and their impact on the country were the main factor behind the revision.\n\nFiscal upheaval", "publish_ts": 1745971200000, "source": "CNBC Economy", "entity_id": "Reichstag", "sent_pos": 0.13884803652763367, "sent_neg": 0.8406451344490051, "ner_org": ["Reichstag", "Getty Images", "Reuters", "the European Central Bank's", "Deutsche Bank", "ECB", "Reuters", "ING", "the European Union"], "ner_gpe": ["Germany", "Germany", "China", "U.S", "Germany", "U.S.", "Germany", "U.S.", "U.S."], "ner": ["Reichstag", "Getty Images", "Germany", "Germany"], "topics": ["the", "and", "from", "inflation", "country"], "_debug_sentiment_label": "negative", "_debug_ner_all": [{"text": "Two", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "German", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "Reichstag", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Getty Images", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "German", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "2.2%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "April", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "annual", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "March", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Wednesday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Reuters", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "2.1%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "2.3%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "March", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "annual", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "2.9%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "April", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "2.6%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "March", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "3.9%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "3.5%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "the previous month", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "5.4%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "the European Central Bank's", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "2%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "first", "label": "ORDINAL"}, {"text": "Sebastian Becker", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Deutsche Bank", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Wednesday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "ECB", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Becker", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Wednesday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Germany", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "0.2%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "the first quarter", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "three-month", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "German", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "Reuters", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Germany", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "0.2%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "the fourth quarter", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "quarterly", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the previous quarter", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Wednesday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "quarterly", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Carsten Brzeski", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "ING", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Europe", "label": "LOC"}, {"text": "each quarter throughout 2023 and", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "2024", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "two consecutive quarters", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "China", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "U.S", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Donald Trump", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Germany", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "the European Union", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Germany", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "20%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "10%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "German", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "last week", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "2025", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Robert Habeck", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Trump", "label": "PERSON"}], "relevance_label": "long_term", "relevance_score": 0.85}

The U.S. imported $438.9 billion of goods from China in 2024, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, putting it right behind Mexico and above Canada on the list of trading partners by that metric.\n\nWhile many on Wall Street are now saying that a recession for the U.S. is likely in 2025, Slok's predictions are toward the more pessimistic side. Bessent has said the administration expects a \"detox period\" for the economy due to the trade negotiations but not necessarily a recession.\n\nThere is also some evidence of a \"pull-forward\" in orders from before the tariffs were announced, which could keep goods on the shelves for longer than the Apollo timelines sets out.\n\n\"Don't expect empty shelves yet \u2014 [year to date] stock is still up, and demand is slowing,\" Bernstein analyst Aneesha Sherman said in a note to clients Monday.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.", "publish_ts": 1745798400000, "source": "CNBC Economy", "entity_id": "Slok", "sent_pos": 0.01969926431775093, "sent_neg": 0.9524856805801392, "ner_org": ["Slok", "Apollo", "Apollo Global Management", "Apollo Global Management", "Treasury", "CNBC", "the Office of the United States Trade Representative", "Slok", "Apollo", "CNBC"], "ner_gpe": ["US", "U.S.", "China", "U.S.", "China", "U.S.", "U.S.", "U.S.", "China", "Beijing", "China", "China", "U.S.", "U.S.", "China", "Mexico", "Canada", "U.S."], "ner": ["Slok", "Apollo", "US", "U.S."], "topics": ["the", "for", "and", "goods", "that"], "_debug_sentiment_label": "negative", "_debug_ner_all": [{"text": "US", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "a few weeks", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Covid", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Chinese", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "Slok", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Friday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Torsten Slok", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Apollo", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Donald Trump", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "China", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "next month", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Trump", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Americans", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "this summer", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Apollo Global Management", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "2", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "China", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Summer 2025", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Apollo Global Management", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "recent weeks", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Trump", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "April 2", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "China", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Treasury", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Scott Bessent", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Monday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "CNBC", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Squawk Box", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Beijing", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "China", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "145%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "China", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "$438.9 billion", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "China", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "2024", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the Office of the United States Trade Representative", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Mexico", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Canada", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "2025", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Slok", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Apollo", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "year", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Bernstein", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Aneesha Sherman", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Monday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "CNBC", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Michael Bloom", "label": "PERSON"}], "relevance_label": "short_term", "relevance_score": 0.8}

Katy Perry performs onstage during the Katy Perry The Lifetimes Tour 2025. A woman checks her receipt while exiting a store. iStock| Theo Wargo | Hispanolistic | Getty Images\n\nA few weeks ago, as Kiki Rough felt increasingly concerned about the state of the economy, she began thinking about previous periods of financial hardship. Rough thought about the skills she learned for making groceries stretch during the tough times that accompanied past economic downturns. Facing similar feelings of uncertainty about the country's financial future, she began making video guides to recipes from cookbooks published during previous recessions, depressions and wartimes. The 28-year-old told followers that she is not a professional chef, but instead earned her stripes by learning to cook while on food stamps. From Rough's yellow-and-black kitchen in the Chicago suburbs, she teaches viewers how to make cheap meals and at-home replacements for items like breakfast strudel or donuts. She often reminds people to replace ingredients with alternatives they already have in the pantry. \"I keep seeing this joke over and over in the comments: The old poors teaching the new poors,\" Rough told CNBC. \"We just need to share knowledge right now because everyone is scared, and learning is going to give people the security to navigate these situations.\" The self-employed consultant's videos quickly found an audience on TikTok and Instagram . Between both platforms, she's gained 350,000 followers and garnered about 21 million views on videos over the last month, by her count. President Donald Trump's announcement of broad and steep tariffs earlier in April has ratcheted up fears of the U.S. economy tipping into a recession in recent weeks. As Americans like Rough grow increasingly worried about the road ahead, they are harking back to the tips and tricks they employed to scrape by during dark financial chapters like the global financial crisis that exploded in 2008. Google is predicting a spike in search volumes this month for terms related to the recession that came to define the late 2000s. Searches for the \"Global Financial Crisis\" are expected to hit levels not seen since 2010, while inquiries for the \"Great Recession\" are slated to be at their highest rate since the onset of the Covid pandemic.\n\nPorkchops, house parties and jungle juice\n\nOn TikTok, a gaggle of Millennials and Gen Xers has stepped into the roles of older siblings, offering flashbacks and advice to younger people on how to pinch pennies. Some Gen Zers have put out calls to elders for insights on what a recession may feel like at this stage of life, having been too young to feel the full effects of the financial crisis. \"This is, potentially, at least on a large scale, the first time that millennials have been able to be the 'experts' on something,\" said Scott Sills, a 33-year-old marketer in Louisiana. \"We're the experts on getting the rug pulled out from under us.\" Those doling out the advice are taking a trip down memory lane the to tail-end of the aughts. Cheap getaways to Florida were the norm instead of lush trips abroad. They had folders for receipts in case big-ticket purchases went on sale later. Business casual outfits were commonplace at social events because they couldn't afford multiple styles of clothing. Porkchops were a staple dinner given their relative affordability, leading one creator to declare that they \"taste like\" the Great Recession. They drank \"jungle juice\" at house parties, a concoction of various cheap liquors and mixers, instead of cocktails at bars. \"There's things that I didn't realize were 'recession indicators' the first time around that I thought were just the trends,\" said M.A. Lakewood, a writer and professional fundraiser in upstate New York. \"Now, you can see it coming from 10 miles away.\"\n\nCustomers shop for produce at an H-E-B grocery store on Feb. 12, 2025 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty Images\n\nTo be sure, some of the discourse has centered around how inflationary pressures have made a handful of these hacks defunct. Some content creators pointed out that the federal minimum wage has sat at $7.25 per hour since 2009 despite the cost of living skyrocketing. Kimberly Casamento recently began a TikTok series walking viewers through recipes from a cookbook that was focused on affordable meals published in 2009. The New Jersey-based digital media manager said she's found costs for what were then considered low-budget meals ballooning between about 100% and 150%. In addition to sharing the price changes, the 33-year-old gives viewers some tips on how to keep costs down. \"Every aspect of life is so expensive that it's hard for anybody to survive,\" Casamento said. \"If you can cut the cost of your meal by $5, then that's a win.\"\n\n'A very human thing'\n\nThis type of communal knowledge-sharing is common during times of economic belt tightening, according to Megan Way, an associate professor at Babson College who studies family and intergenerational economics. While conversations about how to slash costs or to make meals stretch typically took place among neighbors in the late 2000s, Way said it makes sense that they would now play out in the digital square with the rise of social media. \"It's a very human thing to reach out to others when things are feeling uncertain and try to gain on their experience,\" Way said. \"It can really make a difference for feeling like you're moving forward a little prepared. One of the worst things for an economy is absolute fear.\"\n\nWay said that Americans are quick to look back to the Great Recession for a guide because that downturn was so shocking and widely felt. However, she said there's key differences between that economic situation and what the U.S. is facing today, such as the absence of bad debt that sparked the housing market's crash. Still, she said there's broad uncertainty felt today on several fronts \u2014 be it tied to the economy, geopolitics or domestic policy priorities like slashing the federal workforce or limiting immigration. That can reignite the feeling of unpredictability about what the future will bring that was paramount during the Great Recession, Way said. In 2025, it's clear that economic confidence among the average American is rapidly souring. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment recorded one of its worst readings in more than seven decades this month.\n\nWith that negative economic outlook comes rising stress. When Lukas Battle made a satirical TikTok about feeling like divorces were increasingly common around the time of the Great Recession, the 27-year-old's comments were abuzz with people talking about their parents splitting recently. (Though divorce has been seen as a cultural hallmark of the financial crisis, data shows the rate actually declined during this period.) \"There's a second round of divorces happening as we speak,\" Battle said.\n\nCultural parallels\n\nThat's one of several parallels social media users have drawn between the late aughts and today. When videos surfaced of a group dancing to Doechii's hit song \"Anxiety,\" several commenters on X reported feeling d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to when flashmob performances were common. Disney 's reboot of the animated show \"Phineas and Ferb,\" which originally premiered in the late 2000s, similarly put the era top of mind.\n\nLady Gaga performing at Coachella 2017 Getty Images | Christopher Polk", "publish_ts": 1745625600000, "source": "CNBC Economy", "entity_id": "Kiki Rough", "sent_pos": 0.07160771638154984, "sent_neg": 0.0906485766172409, "ner_org": ["Kiki Rough", "Rough", "CNBC", "TikTok", "Instagram", "Rough", "Google", "TikTok", "M.A. Lakewood", "Kimberly Casamento", "TikTok", "Casamento", "Babson College", "Way", "Way", "The University of Michigan's", "Disney", "Coachella 2017 Getty Images"], "ner_gpe": ["Hispanolistic", "Chicago", "U.S.", "Porkchops", "Louisiana", "Florida", "New York", "Austin", "Texas", "New Jersey", "U.S."], "ner": ["Kiki Rough", "Rough", "Hispanolistic", "Chicago"], "topics": ["the", "that", "and", "for", "about"], "_debug_sentiment_label": "neutral", "_debug_ner_all": [{"text": "Homemade", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "Katy Perry", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "the Katy Perry The Lifetimes Tour", "label": "FAC"}, {"text": "2025", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Theo Wargo", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Hispanolistic", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "A few weeks ago", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Kiki Rough", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "28-year-old", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Rough", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Chicago", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "CNBC", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "TikTok", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Instagram", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "350,000", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "about 21 million", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "the last month", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Donald Trump", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "earlier in", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "April", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "recent weeks", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Americans", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "Rough", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "2008", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Google", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "this month", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the late 2000s", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Global Financial Crisis", "label": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"text": "2010", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the \"Great Recession", "label": "LAW"}, {"text": "Porkchops", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "TikTok", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Gen Xers", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Gen Zers", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "first", "label": "ORDINAL"}, {"text": "Scott Sills", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "33-year-old", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Louisiana", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Florida", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "one", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "the Great Recession", "label": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"text": "first", "label": "ORDINAL"}, {"text": "M.A. Lakewood", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "New York", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "10 miles", "label": "QUANTITY"}, {"text": "Feb. 12, 2025", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Austin", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Texas", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Brandon Bell", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Getty Images", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "7.25", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "2009", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Kimberly Casamento", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "TikTok", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "2009", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "New Jersey", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "between about 100% and 150%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "33-year-old", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Casamento", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "5", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "Megan Way", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Babson College", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "the late 2000s", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Way", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "One", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "Americans", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "the Great Recession", "label": "FAC"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "today", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "today", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the Great Recession", "label": "FAC"}, {"text": "Way", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "2025", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "American", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "The University of Michigan's", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "one", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "more than seven decades this month", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Lukas Battle", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "the Great Recession", "label": "FAC"}, {"text": "27-year-old", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "second", "label": "ORDINAL"}, {"text": "Battle", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "one", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "today", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Doechii", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Disney", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Phineas and Ferb", "label": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"text": "the late 2000s", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Lady Gaga", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Coachella 2017 Getty Images", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Christopher Polk", "label": "PERSON"}], "relevance_label": "short_term", "relevance_score": 0.8}

Then we have to take into account the [German] fiscal push by the defense investments, by the infrastructure fund.\" \"We have seen successive movements, you know, announcement [of U.S. tariffs], and then a pause, and then some exemptions. So we have to be very attentive... Either we cut, either we pause, but we will be data dependent to the extreme.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nOn market moves: \"When we had done our projections, we anticipated that... the dollar would appreciate, the euro would depreciate. It's not what we saw.

Basically, uncertainty is like a tax without revenue.\" On the inflation impact: \"In the short run, we will have lower growth. We will probably also have lower inflation. As we also see, the euro is appreciating as energy prices have also come down. So together with the sort of negative factor uncertainty in the short run, it's crystal clear that it will accelerate the disinflation.\"\n\nwatch now\n\n\"But in the medium term, the inflation outlook is not all that clear. I think there are still these negative factors. But in the medium term, you might get retaliation. You might get the disruption of global value chains, which might also be inflationary in other parts of the world than the U.S. only. And then, of course, we have the fiscal policy coming in in Europe. So this is actually a time in which you need projections.\" On a June rate cut and market pricing for two more ECB rate cuts in 2025: \"I'm fully open minded. I think it's way too early to already take a position on June, whether it would be another cut. It will fully depend on these projections.\" \"I would need to see a more structured analysis of the impact on the inflation profile ahead of us, and only then can I say whether the market is pricing fair or whether I don't.\"\n\nRobert Holzmann, Austrian National Bank governor\n\nOn the need to wait for more data and news on tariffs: \"We have not seen this uncertainty now for years... unless the uncertainty subsides, by the right decisions, we will have to hold back a number of our decisions, and hence, we don't know yet in what direction monetary policy should be best moved.\" \"Before looking at data in detail, the question is, what kind of political decisions will be taken? Is it that we will have some tariff increases? Is it that we will have strong tariff increases? Is it that we will have retribution by high counter tariffs?\"\n\nwatch now\n\nOn the ECB's April rate cut: \"I think there's a broad consensus [on rates]. But of course, at the margin, people differ.\" \"My assessment is that at this time, it wasn't clear yet to what extent [tariff] countermeasures were being taken. Because with countermeasures in Europe, prices may have increased. Without countermeasures, quite likely the price pressure is downward. And for the time being, we don't know yet the direction.\" On the direction of interest rates: \"I think if the recent noises about an arrangement [on trade] were to be true, in this case, quite likely it is more towards the downside than the upside with regard to prices.

But he said it wasn't because of the market tumult.\n\nMarkets recoiled following the release. Treasury yields initially headed lower but quickly snapped higher. The 10-year yield rose half a percentage point in just a few days, one of its quickest moves ever, as investors also ditched stocks and the U.S. dollar.\n\nIn the decree, Trump slapped 10% across-the-board duties against all U.S. imports and released a list of tariffs against dozens of other nations. The extra levies were based on trade deficits the U.S. had against the respective countries and raised fears about inflation, a potential recession and disruption of long-held trade agreements.\n\n\"I wasn't worried,\" Trump said in a Time magazine interview during which he was asked about financial market tumult after his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump denied that a strong bond market sell-off influenced his decision earlier this month to hold off on aggressive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against U.S. trading partners.\n\n\"No, it wasn't for that reason,\" Trump told Time in the interview from Tuesday that was published Friday. \"I'm doing that until we come up with the numbers that I want to come up with. I've met with a lot of countries. I've talked on the telephone. I don't even want them to come in.\"\n\nYields have since moved lower, with the 10-year most recently around 4.28%, about a quarter percentage point higher than its recent low. Trump had said when he made the decision to hold off that the bond market had gotten the \"yips.\"\n\n\"The bond market was getting the yips, but I wasn't. Because I know what we have,\" he said. \"I know what we have, but I also know we won't have it for long if we allowed four more years of the gross incompetence. This thing was just running \u2014 it was running as a free spirit. This was \u2014 this was the most incompetent president in history.\"\n\nThough negotiations over tariffs are ongoing, Trump added that he would consider it a \"total victory\" even if the U.S. has levies as high as 50% still in place a year from now.\n\nGet Your Ticket to Pro LIVE\n\nJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!\n\nUncertain markets?

Andreas Rentz | Getty Images\n\nQuasi-governmental financial firm Fannie Mae on Wednesday announced a partnership with defense tech player Palantir to detect mortgage fraud, deepening ties between the federal government and a company that has been a big winner in the second Trump administration. Priscilla Almodovar, Fannie Mae CEO, said Wednesday at a press event that the goal is for the firm to \"identify fraud more proactively\" with the help of Palantir, starting with its multi-family housing business. An early test showed that Palantir's technology, which includes elements of artificial intelligence, could identify fraud in seconds that took human investigators two months to find, she said. Shares of Palantir have jumped more than 140% since President Donald Trump's election win in November. The technology stock has roles in both modernizing the U.S. military and helping to cut costs in government, making it a seemingly strong fit for the administration's stated priorities. CEO Alex Karp said Wednesday that the mortgage fraud detection can be done in a way that \"protects the underlying data and protects the privacy of the people submitting their forms.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Shares of Palantir have dramatically outperformed the broader stock market since the November election.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises that have been under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Financing Agency since 2008. The official names of the two enterprises are the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, respectively. FHFA director William Pulte said Wednesday the Palantir program could be expanded to Freddie Mac in the future and that the agency is also talking to Elon Musk's xAI firm about a potential partnership. \"The sky's the limit. We're not just limited to fraud. If there are ways to pull cost out of the system, we want to do it,\" Pulte said. The press release did not include a dollar amount that Fannie Mae would pay to Palantir for this service. The announcement comes as there is a push to potentially bring Fannie and Freddie out of conservatorship and re-establish them as something closer to independent companies. \"Our great Mortgage Agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, provide a vital service to our Nation by helping hardworking Americans reach the American Dream \u2014 Home Ownership,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Tuesday. \"I am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES, and I will stay strong in my position on overseeing them as President. These Agencies are now doing very well, and will help us to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The \"implicit guarantee\" mentioned by Trump refers to the idea among investors that the government won't let Fannie and Freddie default on their mortgage-backed securities. That concept is not legally binding but does help that massive market function and, in theory, lead to lower mortgage rates by reducing the perceived risk to investors in the housing market.\n\nwatch now", "publish_ts": 1748390400000, "source": "CNBC Top News", "entity_id": "FMCC", "sent_pos": 0.2966710329055786, "sent_neg": 0.013809497468173504, "ner_org": ["FMCC", "Palantir Technologies", "Digital", "Fannie Mae", "Trump", "Fannie Mae", "Palantir", "Palantir", "Chart Icon Stock", "Fannie Mae", "Freddie Mac", "the Federal Housing Financing Agency", "the Federal National Mortgage Association", "the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation", "FHFA", "Freddie Mac", "Fannie Mae", "Fannie", "Freddie", "Fannie Mae", "Freddie Mac", "Nation", "Truth Social", "the U.S. Government", "Trump", "Fannie", "Freddie"], "ner_gpe": ["Cologne", "Germany", "U.S."], "ner": ["FMCC", "Palantir Technologies", "Cologne", "Germany"], "topics": ["the", "and", "that", "palantir", "fannie"], "_debug_sentiment_label": "neutral", "_debug_ner_all": [{"text": "FMCC", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Alex Karp", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Palantir Technologies", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Digital", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Cologne", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Germany", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Sept. 7, 2021", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Andreas Rentz", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Fannie Mae", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Wednesday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Palantir", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "second", "label": "ORDINAL"}, {"text": "Trump", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Priscilla Almodovar", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Fannie Mae", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Wednesday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Palantir", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Palantir", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "seconds", "label": "TIME"}, {"text": "two months", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Palantir", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "more than 140%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "Donald Trump", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "November", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Alex Karp", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Wednesday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Chart Icon Stock", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Palantir", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "November", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Fannie Mae", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Freddie Mac", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "the Federal Housing Financing Agency", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "2008", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "two", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "the Federal National Mortgage Association", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "FHFA", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "William Pulte", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Wednesday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Palantir", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Freddie Mac", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Elon Musk's", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Pulte", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Fannie Mae", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Palantir", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Fannie", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Freddie", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Fannie Mae", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Freddie Mac", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Nation", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Americans", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "American", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "Trump", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Truth Social", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Tuesday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the U.S. Government", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Trump", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Fannie", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Freddie", "label": "ORG"}], "relevance_label": "short_term", "relevance_score": 0.9}

Market expectations have responded in kind, with futures traders now pricing in virtually no chance of a cut until the Fed's September meeting.\n\nTrade policy also has evolved since the Fed last gathered.\n\nTariffs and ongoing saber-rattling between the U.S. and China eased a few days after the central bank meeting, with both sides agreeing to drop the most onerous duties against each pending a 90-day negotiation period. That in turn helped kindle a rally on Wall Street, though bond yields continue to climb, something President Donald Trump has sought to contain.\n\nAmid the trade war and signs that inflation is slowly coming in toward the Fed's 2% target, Trump has hectored central bank officials to lower rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, though, has said the Fed won't be swayed by political interference.\n\nThe meeting also featured discussion about the Fed's five-year policy framework.\n\nWhen officials last visited their long-range policy, they devised what became known as \"flexible average inflation targeting,\" which essentially asserted that officials could allow inflation to run above their 2% target for a while in the interest of promoting more inclusive labor market gains.\n\nIn their discussion, officials noted that the strategy \"has diminished benefits in an environment with a substantial risk of large inflationary shocks\" or rates aren't near zero, where they had been in the years after the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed held interest rates near the lower boundary despite inflation surging following the Covid pandemic, forcing them into aggressive hikes later.\n\nThe minutes noted a desire for policy that is \"robust to a wide variety of economic environments.\" Officials also said they have no intention on altering the inflation goal.", "publish_ts": 1748390400000, "source": "CNBC Top News", "entity_id": "Federal Reserve", "sent_pos": 0.5412927865982056, "sent_neg": 0.39220452308654785, "ner_org": ["Federal Reserve", "the Federal Open Market Committee", "Committee", "Committee", "Fed", "Fed", "Fed", "Trump", "Fed", "Fed", "Fed", "Fed"], "ner_gpe": ["U.S.", "China"], "ner": ["Federal Reserve", "the Federal Open Market Committee", "U.S.", "China"], "topics": ["the", "that", "and", "policy", "inflation"], "_debug_sentiment_label": "positive", "_debug_ner_all": [{"text": "Federal Reserve", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "earlier this month", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "minutes", "label": "TIME"}, {"text": "Wednesday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "May 6", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the Federal Open Market Committee", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Committee", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "December", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "between 4.25%-4.5%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "Committee", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Fed", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "September", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Fed", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "China", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "a few days", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "90-day", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Donald Trump", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Fed", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "2%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "Trump", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Fed", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Jerome Powell", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Fed", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Fed", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "five-year", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "2%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "zero", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "the years after the 2008", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Fed", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Covid", "label": "PERSON"}], "relevance_label": "long_term", "relevance_score": 0.85}

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 As China tightens its grip on the global supply of key minerals, the West is working to reduce its dependence on Chinese rare earth. This includes finding alternative sources of rare earth minerals, developing technologies to reduce reliance, and recovering existing stockpiles through recycling products that are reaching the end of their shelf life. \"You cannot build a modern car without rare earths,\" said consulting firm AlixPartners, noting how Chinese companies have come to dominate the supply chain for the minerals. In September 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense invested $4.2 million in Rare Earth Salts, a startup that aims to extract the oxides from domestic recycled products such as fluorescent light bulbs. Japan's Toyota has also been investing in technologies to reduce the use of rare earth elements. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, China controlled 69% of rare earth mine production in 2024, and nearly half of the world's reserves. Analysts from AlixPartners estimate that a typical single-motor battery electric vehicle includes around 550 grams (1.21 pounds) of components containing rare earths, unlike gasoline-powered cars, which only use 140 grams of rare earths, or about 5 ounces.\n\nPretty soon, the first generation of EVs will be up for recycling themselves, creating a pool of ex-China material that will be under the control of the West. Christopher Ecclestone Principal and mining strategist at Hallgarten & Company\n\nMore than half of the new passenger cars sold in China are battery-only and hybrid-powered cars, unlike the U.S., where they are still mostly gasoline-powered. \"With slowing EV uptake (in the U.S.) and mandates to convert from ICE to EV formats receding into the future, the imperative for replacing Chinese-sourced materials in EVs is declining,\" said Christopher Ecclestone, principal and mining strategist at Hallgarten & Company. \"Pretty soon, the first generation of EVs will be up for recycling themselves, creating a pool of ex-China material that will be under the control of the West,\" he said.\n\nOnly 7.5% of new U.S. vehicle sales in the first quarter were electric, a modest increase from a year ago, according to Cox Automotive. It pointed out that around two-thirds of EVs sold in the U.S. last year were assembled locally, but manufacturers still rely on imports for the parts. \"The current, full-blown trade war with China, the world's leading supplier of EV battery materials, will distort the market even more.\"\n\nRare torque\n\nOf the 1.7 kilograms (3.74 pounds) of components containing rare earths found in a typical single-motor battery electric car, 550 grams (1.2 pounds) are rare earths. About the same amount, 510 grams, is used in hybrid-powered vehicles using lithium-ion batteries.\n\nIn early April, China announced export controls on seven rare earths. Those restrictions included terbium, 9 grams of which is typically used in a single-motor EV, AlixPartners data showed. None of the six other targeted rare earths are significantly used in cars, according to the data. But April's list is not the only one. A separate Chinese list of metal controls that took effect in December restricts exports of cerium, 50 grams of which AlixPartners said is used on average in a single-motor EV. The controls mean that Chinese companies handling the minerals must get government approval to sell them overseas. Caixin, a Chinese business news outlet, reported on May 15, just days after a U.S.-China trade truce, that three leading Chinese rare earth magnet companies have received export licenses from the commerce ministry to ship to North America and Europe. What's concerning for international business is that there are barely any alternatives to China for obtaining the rare earths. Mines can take years to get operating approval, while processing plants also take time and expertise to establish. \"Today, China controls over 90% of the global refined supply for the four magnet rare earth elements (Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb), which are used to make permanent magnets for EV motors,\" the International Energy Agency said in a statement. That refers to neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium.\n\nwatch now\n\nFor the less commonly used nickel metal hydride batteries in hybrid cars, the amount of rare earths goes up to 4.45 kilograms, or nearly 10 pounds, according to AlixPartners. That's largely because that kind of battery uses 3.5 kilograms of lanthanum. \"I estimate that around 70% of the over 200 kilograms of minerals in an EV goes through China, but it varies by vehicle and manufacturer. It's hard to put a definitive figure on it,\" said Henry Sanderson, associate fellow at The Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security.\n\nPower projection\n\nHowever, there are limits to recycling, which remains challenging, energy-intensive and time-consuming. And even if adoption of EVs in the U.S. slows, the minerals are used in far larger quantities in defense. For example, the F-35 fighter jet contains over 900 pounds of rare earths, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, based in Washington, D.C. China's rare earths restrictions also go beyond the closely watched list released on April 4.\n\nLarge rocks containing chromite, is crushed into smaller bitesize chunks, before to goes through a process to refine and extract the ore that yields chromium, a vital component of stainless steel, at the Mughulkhil mine in Logar Province, Afghanistan. Marcus Yam | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nIn the last two years, China has increased its control over a broader category of metals known as critical minerals. In the summer of 2023, China said it would restrict exports of gallium and germanium, both used in chipmaking. About a year later, it announced restrictions on antimony, used to strengthen other metals and a significant component in bullets, nuclear weapons production and lead-acid batteries. The State Council, the country's top executive body, in October released an entire policy for strengthening controls of exports, including minerals, that might have dual-use properties, or be used for military and civilian purposes.\n\n\n\nSubscribe now Weekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox", "publish_ts": 1748390400000, "source": "CNBC Top News", "entity_id": "Neo

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/25/ai-drives-growth-for-a-few-chinese-companies-analysts-share-picks.html", "title": "AI drives growth for a few Chinese companies. Analysts share their picks", "body": "Spending on artificial intelligence helped give some Chinese tech companies a boost in the first quarter, despite economic headwinds. \"The standout for this [first quarter] reporting season was the growth in cloud business for Alibaba and Baidu ,\" said Brian Tycangco, an analyst at Stansberry Research. Alibaba said earlier this month its cloud revenue in the latest quarter rose by 18% year on year , while Baidu on Wednesday said its AI cloud business grew by 42% . \"At these rates of growth, cloud business is poised to become the 2nd largest business segment for both companies,\" Tycangco said. \"More importantly, cloud will become the basis for a return to heady growth days after several years of single-digit topline growth.\" Alibaba, Tencent and JD.com also reported double-digit growth in marketing revenue, which they said were bolstered by AI tools that were able to target consumers more effectively. The trend signals a fundamental change in Chinese markets. \"AI/Tech/New Economy [are] further gaining traction as equity market leaders,\" Morgan Stanley's chief China equity strategist Laura Wang said in a May 20 note. \"We believe that a new generation of equity market leaders is forming in these sectors, after a 5-year-long disruption period post market peak in early 2021,\" she said, noting how consumer and internet stocks previously led gains. Out of Morgan Stanley's 60 Chinese AI stock picks, those rated overweight, traded in Hong Kong and with expected upside of more than 50% as of May 19 are: Gushengtang \u2014 This health-care company is focused on traditional Chinese medicine, and it's training targeted AI models to create an \"AI physician assistant.\" The company said customer visits rose by 12.7% in the first quarter to 1.21 million. Bairong \u2014 This cloud-based AI services company is focused on state-owned banks and other financial services companies. The company added in its 2024 annual report that Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms use Bairong's AI model service to evaluate consumers' purchasing power. When it comes to more popular names, the Morgan Stanley analysts prefer Alibaba and Tencent over Baidu and iFlytek. They also prefer Meituan, Meitu and Trip.com over Kuaishou and JD.com. Among mainland China-listed companies, 68% mentioned AI in their 2024 annual reports, up from 43% in the first half of 2024, HSBC Qianhai Securities head of research Steven Sun, said in a May 16 report. \u201cWe also observed a slightly upward revision of 2025e consensus capex for major cloud service providers after 1Q25 results, suggesting they are still upbeat about their AI business.\u201d The information technology sector saw earnings rise by 24.7% in the first quarter from a year ago on improving AI penetration, the HSBC report said, noting it was one of the fastest-growing sectors. One of HSBC's buy-rated picks is enterprise software and cybersecurity company Sangfor, listed in Shenzhen, with a price target of 143 yuan. The firm thinks accelerating AI adoption can help drive earnings growth. Chinese-developed DeepSeek surprised global investors in late January with its ability to rival OpenAI's ChatGPT, while claiming a fraction of development cost. In the months since, several Chinese companies have also released new AI tools for generating video or 3D models. China's recent tech breakthroughs stem from the country's breadth of engineers, data and vast social media and e-commerce ecosystem, the Morgan Stanley analysts said, noting how government support can enable faster tech adoption. \"We continue to believe that such structural improvement would be less susceptible to the ongoing tariff dispute and the overall macro challenges,\" the report said. \u201cThis is important in attracting foreign investors to build long-term commitments of allocation, as they discover a decent number of companies that are distinctive and exclusively available in China, despite the broad macro slowdown.\u201d Listed Chinese stocks generate the majority of their revenue domestically, with only 3% U.S. revenue exposure, the analysts said. \u2014 CNBC's Michael

Intuit \u2014 Shares of Intuit, which owns TurboTax and QuickBooks software, popped 7.5% after the company reported strong quarterly results . Intuit said its revenue in the fiscal third quarter increased 15% to $7.8 billion. Apple \u2014 The tech giant's stock slid 2.6% after President Donald Trump threatened that Apple will have to pay a tariff of 25% or more for iPhones made outside the U.S. Production of Apple's flagship phone happens primarily in China, but the company has been shifting manufacturing to India amid Trump's trade war. Nuclear stocks \u2014 Stocks tied to nuclear energy got a bump after Reuters reported , citing sources, that Trump will sign orders to boost nuclear power as soon as Friday. Shares of Oklo and NuScale popped 24% and 14.5%, respectively, while Cameco rose 9%. Constellation Energy added 2.8%. Ross Stores \u2014 Shares fell 11% after the off-price retailer withdrew its full-year forecasts , citing uncertainty around tariffs. Ross Stores' second-quarter earnings guidance was also below Wall Street's expectations. Deckers Outdoor \u2014 The Ugg boots maker saw its shares drop 19% after Deckers declined to provide full-year guidance for fiscal 2026, citing \"macroeconomic uncertainty related to evolving global trade policies.\" Wolfspeed \u2014 Shares of the semiconductor components maker plunged 13%. The company is preparing to file for bankruptcy within weeks. StepStone Group \u2014 The investment firm climbed more than 4% after results for the fiscal first-quarter beat expectations.

Adjusted revenue of $295.9 million was also ahead of a $229.4 million projection. Workday \u2014 Shares of the human resources software company dropped 11.8%.

But I feel like the bar for me is a little higher for action in any direction while we're waiting to get some clarity,\" Goolsbee said on \"Squawk Box\" when asked about Trump's new actions Friday morning. \"Over the longer run, if they're putting in place tariffs that have a stagflationary impact \u2026 then that's the central bank's worst situation.\"\n\n\"So I think we'll have to see how big the impacts on prices are,\" he added. \"I know people hate inflation.\"\n\nGoolsbee spoke as Trump jolted markets again with a call for 50% tariffs on products from the European Union starting June 1, while indicating Apple will have to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones not made in the U.S. Apple mostly makes its coveted smartphones in China, though there is some production in India as well.\n\nWhile the impact of a costlier iPhone likely wouldn't mean much from a larger economic perspective, the saber-rattling underscores the volatility of trade policy and provides another flash point for a market already unnerved by worries about fiscal policy that have sent bond yields sharply higher.\n\nCentral bankers are generally careful not to wade into issues of fiscal and trade policy, but are left to analyze their repercussions.\n\nGoolsbee said he is still optimistic that the longer-run trajectory is toward solid economic growth before Trump's April 2 tariff announcement that rattled markets.\n\n\"I'm still underneath hopeful that we can get back to that environment, and 10 to 16 months from now, rates could be a fair bit below where they are today,\" he said.\n\nGoolsbee is a voting member this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which next meets June 17-18.

Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images\n\nThere's a stark contrast between the effects on high earners and those on low-income households in a sprawling legislative package House Republicans passed Thursday. The bulk of the financial benefits in the legislation \u2014 called the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" \u2014 would flow to the wealthiest Americans, courtesy of tax-cutting measures such as those for business owners, investors and homeowners in high-tax areas, experts said. However, low earners would be worse off, they said. That's largely because Republicans partially offset those tax cuts \u2014 estimated to cost about $4 trillion or more \u2014 with reductions to social safety net programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, formerly known as food stamps. The tax and spending package now heads to the Senate, where it may face further changes.\n\n'It skews pretty heavily toward the wealthy'\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal scorekeeper, estimates income for the bottom 10% of households would fall by 2% in 2027 and by 4% in 2033 as a result of the bill's changes. By contrast, those in the top 10% would get an income boost from the legislation: 4% in 2027 and 2% in 2033, CBO found.\n\nwatch now\n\nA Yale Budget Lab analysis found a similar dynamic. The bottom 20% of households \u2014 who make less than $14,000 a year \u2014 would see their annual incomes fall about $800 in 2027, on average, Yale estimates. The top 20% \u2014 who earn over $128,000 a year \u2014 would see theirs grow by $9,700, on average, in 2027. The top 1% would gain $63,000. The Yale and CBO analyses don't account for last-minute changes to the House legislation, including stricter work requirements for Medicaid. \"It skews pretty heavily toward the wealthy,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Biden administration. The legislation compounds the regressive nature of the Trump administration's recent tariff policies, economists said. \"If you incorporated the [Trump administration's] hike in tariffs, this would be even more skewed against lower- and working-class families,\" Tedeschi said.\n\nMost tax cuts in the bill go to top-earning households\n\nThere are several ways the House bill skews toward the wealthiest Americans, experts said. Among them are more valuable tax breaks tied to business income, state and local taxes and the estate tax, experts said. These tax breaks disproportionately flow to high earners, experts said. For example, the bottom 80% of earners would see no benefit from the House proposal to raise the SALT cap to $40,000 from the current $10,000, according to the Tax Foundation. More from Personal Finance:\n\nTax bill includes $1,000 baby bonus in 'Trump Accounts'\n\nHouse bill boosts maximum child tax credit to $2,500\n\nFood stamps face 'biggest cut in the program's history' The bill also preserves a lower top tax rate, at 37%, set by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which would have expired at the end of the year. It kept a tax break intact that allows investors to shield their capital gains from tax by funneling money into \"opportunity zones.\" Trump's 2017 tax law created that tax break, with the aim of incentivizing investment in lower-income areas designated by state governors. Taxpayers with capital gains are \"highly concentrated\" among the wealthy, according to the Tax Policy Center. All told, 60% of the bill's tax cuts would go to the top 20% of households and more than a third would go to those making $460,000 or more, according to the Tax Policy Center. \"The variation among income groups is striking,\" the analysis said.\n\nWhy many low earners are worse off\n\nThat said, more than 8 in 10 households overall would get a tax cut in 2026 if the bill is enacted, the Tax Policy Center found. Lower earners stand to benefit from provisions including a higher standard deduction and temporarily enhanced child tax credit, and tax breaks tied to tip income and car loan interest, for example, experts said. However, some of those benefits may not be as valuable as they seem at first glance, experts said. For example, roughly one-third of tipped workers don't pay federal income tax, Tedeschi said. They wouldn't benefit from the proposed tax break on tips \u2014 it's structured as a tax deduction, which doesn't benefit households without tax liability, he said.\n\nwatch now\n\nMeanwhile, lower-income households, which rely more on federal safety net programs, would see cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and benefits linked to student loans and Affordable Care Act premiums, said Kent Smetters, an economist and faculty director at the Penn Wharton Budget Model. The House bill would, for example, impose work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP beneficiaries. Total federal spending on those programs would fall by about $700 billion and $267 billion, respectively, through 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office analysis. That said, \"if you are low income and don't get SNAP, Medicaid or ACA premium support, you will be slightly better off,\" Smetters said.\n\nSome high earners would pay more in tax", "publish_ts": 1747958400000, "source": "CNBC Top News", "entity_id": "House", "sent_pos": 0.026729993522167206, "sent_neg": 0.9246885180473328, "ner_org": ["House", "House", "Medicaid", "the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program", "Senate", "The Congressional Budget Office", "CBO", "Yale", "Yale", "CBO", "House", "Medicaid", "the Yale Budget Lab", "the White House Council of Economic Advisers", "House", "House", "SALT", "the Tax Foundation", "House", "Trump", "the Tax Policy Center", "the Tax Policy Center", "the Tax Policy Center", "Medicaid", "the Penn Wharton Budget Model", "House", "Medicaid", "the Congressional Budget Office", "Medicaid", "ACA"], "ner_gpe": ["U.S.", "Washington, DC"], "ner": ["House", "House", "U.S.", "Washington, DC"], "topics": ["the", "tax", "and", "would", "said"], "_debug_sentiment_label": "negative", "_debug_ner_all": [{"text": "House", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "May 22, 2025", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Washington, DC", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Kevin Dietsch", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Getty Images", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "House", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Republicans", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "Thursday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "One", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "Americans", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "Republicans", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "about $4 trillion", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "Medicaid", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Senate", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "The Congressional Budget Office", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "10%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "2%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "2027", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "4%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "2033", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "10%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "4%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "2027", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "2%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "2033", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "CBO", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "20%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "less than $14,000", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "annual", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "about $800", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "2027", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Yale", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "20%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "over $128,000", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "9,700", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "2027", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "1%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "63,000", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "Yale", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "CBO", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "last-minute", "label": "TIME"}, {"text": "House", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Medicaid", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Ernie Tedeschi", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "the Yale Budget Lab", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "the White House Council of Economic Advisers", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Biden", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Trump", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Trump", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Tedeschi", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "House", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Americans", "label": "NORP"}, {"text": "80%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "House", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "SALT", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "40,000", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "10,000", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "the Tax Foundation", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "1,000", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "Trump Accounts'\n\n", "label": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"text": "House", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "2,500", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "37%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "2017", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the end of the year", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Trump", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "2017", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the Tax Policy Center", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "60%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "20%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "more than a third", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "460,000", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "the Tax Policy Center", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "more than 8", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "10", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "2026", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the Tax Policy Center", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "first", "label": "ORDINAL"}, {"text": "roughly one-third", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "Tedeschi", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Medicaid", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Affordable Care Act", "label": "LAW"}, {"text": "Kent Smetters", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "the Penn Wharton Budget Model", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "House", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Medicaid", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "about $700 billion and $267 billion", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "2034", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "the Congressional Budget Office", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Medicaid", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "ACA", "label": "ORG"}], "relevance_label": "long_term", "relevance_score": 0.85}

I'm a doctor, and I'm looking at the patient, and I've said, you're having this accumulation, and I can tell you that this is very, very serious, and I can't tell you the exact time. I would say that if we're really looking over the next three years, to give or take a year or two, that we're in that type of a critical, critical situation.\"\n\nThe founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds, has warned about the ballooning U.S. deficit for years. Recently, investors have begun demanding lower prices to buy the bonds that cover the government's massive budget deficits, pushing up yields on the debt. Rising worries about the fiscal situation last week triggered a high-profile credit rating downgrade from Moody's.\n\nThe yield on the 30-year Treasury yield on Thursday traded at levels not seen since 2023, around 5.14%.\n\nRising financing costs along with continued spending growth and declining tax receipts have combined to send deficits spiraling, pushing the national debt past the $36 trillion mark. In 2024, the government spent more on interest payments than any other outlay other than Social Security, defense and health care.\n\n\"We will have a deficit of about 6.5% of GDP \u2014 that that is more than the market can bear,\" Dalio said.\n\nDalio said he's not hopeful politicians would be able to reconcile their differences and lessen the country's debt load. In a party-line vote early Thursday, House members approved legislation that lowers taxes and adds military spending. The bill \u2014 which now goes to the Senate \u2014 could increase the U.S. government's debt by trillions and widen the deficit at a time when fears of a flare-up in inflation due higher tariffs are already weighing on bond prices and boosting yields.\n\n\"I'm not optimistic. I have to be realistic,\" Dalio said. \"I think it's the essence of the challenge of our country that anything related to bipartisanship and getting over political hurdles ... essentially means 'give me more,' which leads to these deficits.\"", "publish_ts": 1747872000000, "source": "CNBC Top News", "entity_id": "the Paley Media Council", "sent_pos": 0.11147621273994446, "sent_neg": 0.8191543817520142, "ner_org": ["the Paley Media Council", "Bridgewater Associates", "Moody's", "Treasury", "Social Security", "House", "Senate"], "ner_gpe": ["U.S.", "New York", "U.S.", "U.S."], "ner": ["the Paley Media Council", "Bridgewater Associates", "U.S.", "New York"], "topics": ["the", "and", "that", "dalio", "debt"], "_debug_sentiment_label": "negative", "_debug_ner_all": [{"text": "Ray Dalio", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "Thursday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "Dalio", "label": "PERSON"}, {"text": "the Paley Media Council", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "New York", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "the next three years", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "a year or", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "two", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "Bridgewater Associates", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "one", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "years", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "last week", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Moody's", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "30-year", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Treasury", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Thursday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "2023", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "around 5.14%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "$36 trillion", "label": "MONEY"}, {"text": "2024", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "Social Security", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "about 6.5%", "label": "PERCENT"}, {"text": "early Thursday", "label": "DATE"}, {"text": "House", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "Senate", "label": "ORG"}, {"text": "U.S.", "label": "GPE"}, {"text": "trillions", "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"text": "Dalio", "label": "PERSON"}], "relevance_label": "long_term", "relevance_score": 0.85}

In a pre-tariffs world, dealmakers were encouraged by the Trump administration's pro-business flavor and deregulatory agenda, as well as previously easing concerns about inflation. Those trends were expected to fuel an even stronger M&A comeback in 2025, after last year's moderate recovery from a slow 2023.\n\nThis year's appetite for dealmaking came back quickly after Trump suspended his highest tariffs and market jitters took a backseat. If borrowing costs remain in check, many expect activity could be brisk.\n\n\"More clarity on trade policy and rebounding equities markets have set the stage for continued M&A, even in sectors hit especially hard by tariffs,\" Kevin Ketcham, a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Mergermarket, told CNBC.\n\nThe total value of U.S. deals jumped to more than $227 billion in March, which saw 586 deals, before suddenly slowing down in April to roughly 650 deals worth about $134 billion, according to data compiled by Mergermarket.\n\nSo far this month, activity is rebounding and the average deal has been larger. More than 300 deals collectively valued at more than $125 billion have been struck this month as of May 20, Mergermarket said.\n\nThat's encouraging.

Moving factory work back to the U.S would mean a significant increase in labor costs, which many companies simply could not afford, the Wall Street bank said. Even if they are willing to absorb or pass the higher prices onto consumers, companies are challenged by an already tight labor market for production workers. \"A meaningful increase in factory jobs does not appear likely in the foreseeable future, in our view,\" Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, said in a research report. \"Higher prices and policy uncertainty may weigh on firms' ability and willingness to expand payrolls.\" The Trump administration believes a reshoring boom is on the horizon in the wake of a trade war that brings the effective tariff rate facing importers to the highest level since the 1940s, even accounting for the recent pause on some of the heaviest duties. Trump has also promised tax cuts for companies that bring back manufacturing to the U.S. There have been a few of high-profile announcements from the tech sector , including Nvidia's plans for a supercomputer plant in the U.S. and Apple's commitment to invest $500 billion at home. 'Uphill battle' Still, restoring manufacturing employment back to its heyday seems to be a fool's errand, according to Wells Fargo.

The new Xiaomi 15S Pro starts at 5,499 yuan ($764) \u2014 making it eligible for a state-subsidized discount \u2014 and is significantly cheaper than Apple models containing the company's most advanced phone chip. The iPhone 16 Pro starts at 7,999 yuan, while the iPhone Pro Max model begins at 9,999 yuan \u2014 above the 6,000 yuan cut-off for a Chinese government discount for consumers.\n\nAnd Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun claims his company also has a competitive chip, saying at a launch event on Thursday that Xiaomi's new Xring O1 beat Apple's A18 Pro on several technical metrics, including the ability to operate a game with less heat.\n\nCNBC has not independently verified these claims. CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.\n\n\"Apple is still number one,\" Lei said in Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation. He said the Xring O1's performance should not be seen as an attempt to pressure Apple, but rather as an indicator of the great effort Xiaomi made to develop a comparable processor.\n\nThe U.S. has increasingly restricted China's ability to access high-end equipment for developing advanced semiconductors used in training artificial intelligence models.\n\nLei did not discuss any significant AI features for the 15S Pro, but showed how it could be used to lock and unlock a compatible car.\n\nHe announced that Xiaomi will spend 200 billion yuan on research and development in the next five years, starting from 2026, and predicted 30% revenue growth this year.\n\nLei had teased the 3 nanometer chip last week on Chinese social media app Weibo. He later noted the chip is in mass production and said the company would invest at least 50 billion yuan ($6.9 billion) over the next 10 years in its own chip development.\n\nApple's iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max use A18 Pro chips built on the same 3 nanometer process.\n\nAround 40% of Xiaomi's phones currently use chips by Qualcomm and MediaTek, according to Counterpoint Research Partner Niel Shah.\n\nXiaomi spent 13.5 billion ($1.87 billion) over four years to develop the Xring O1, Lei said in a social media post. He revealed that the company started developing chips in 2014 and unveiled one in 2017, before temporarily suspending such research.\n\nLast spring, Xiaomi launched its first electric car, the SU7 sedan, with a price $4,000 below that of Tesla's Model 3 at the time. Ford CEO Jim Farley said he spent months driving a Xiaomi electric car, as he tried to assess competition from Chinese automakers.\n\nXiaomi's first SUV, called the YU7, will be officially released in July, Lei said in a social media post, noting the car's price wouldn't be revealed Thursday. Lei did share some promotional images and car features at the event.\n\nLei said the YU7 car would use Qualcomm Snapdragon and Nvidia Thor chips. The standard version of the vehicle will come with advanced driver assist and a driving range of 835 km.\n\nThe company delivered more than 28,000 vehicles in April, down from its record of more than 29,000 during the previous month. That comes after the crash of an SU7 vehicle in China, which left three people dead. China has since required automakers to use more conservative language when advertising driver-assist systems.\n\nXiaomi is set to release its first-quarter results on May 27, after the company in March reported record revenue and net profit for 2024. Sales generated from overseas markets last year accounted for nearly 42% of total revenue.\n\nThe company's shares remain more than 50% higher year-to-date.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Arjun Kharpal and Bernice
