Mike Novogratz's crypto firm Galaxy Digital also debuted on the Nasdaq earlier this month.\n\nCircle had attempted to go public through a $9 billion blank-check deal with Bob Diamond-backed SPAC, but the deal fell apart in late 2022.\n\n\"Circle now returning to the public markets indicates regained confidence \u2014 but at a 25% lower valuation, which reflects more realistic market conditions and less frothy expectations,\" said US Tiger Securities analyst Bo Pei.\n\nSTABLECOIN FOCUS\n\nFounded in 2013, Circle is the issuer of USDC, which has a market capitalization of over $60 billion and is the second-biggest stablecoin after Tether, according to crypto market tracker CoinGecko.\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are usually pegged to a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar. Besides USDC, Circle also issues the euro-denominated stablecoin EURC.\n\nCircle's IPO comes as the stablecoin bill advances through the U.S. Senate, which could further accelerate the adoption of the digital tokens.\n\nJ.P. Morgan estimates the market size for stablecoins could grow to $500 billion to $750 billion over the coming years.", "publish_ts": 1748345274000, "source": "Yahoo Finance"}

You can\u2019t stock a bunch of extra materials ahead of time, because every homeowner wants something different.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s top of mind at this point. On the contractor side, they\u2019re waiting to see how it unfolds,\u201d Julie Kheyfets, CEO of Block Renovation, a platform that connects homeowners with contractors, told CNN.\n\nA recent agreement between the U.S. and China has temporarily lowered that rate to 30% for 90 days, but the broader market remains unsettled. Blanket 10% tariffs remain in effect for many other trading partners, and those rates could climb again after July 9 .\n\nIn 2024, China exported more than $438 billion worth of goods to the U.S., with nearly 19% of that total in machinery and appliances, including refrigerators, dishwashers, laundry machines, and another 4% in furniture and lighting, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.\n\nThe home renovation market has thrived in recent years, bolstered by an aging housing stock and fewer new builds. But that growth is being threatened by U.S. trade policy.\n\n\u201cJust like everything,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to pass that cost along if you want to stay profitable.\u201d\n\nTo survive, Esslinger says the price hikes can\u2019t be absorbed; they have to be passed on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it where sometimes they don\u2019t even warn you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone to a website to look at a product I might have sourced a month ago, and now suddenly it\u2019s a certain percentage more.\u201d\n\nNervous about the stock market in 2025?

Here are 5 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nCosts have been creeping up for Esslinger, telling CNN that one key supplier, providing lighting, rugs and furniture, slapped a 14% \u201ctemporary tariff surcharge\u201d on Chinese imports and 2% on goods from any other countries starting May 12. Another vendor dealing in fabric and wallpaper also warned of imminent price hikes.\n\nChad Esslinger, an interior designer based outside Chicago, says the pressure has been building ever since President Donald Trump introduced sweeping global tariffs in early April.\n\nTariffs are hammering the home renovation industry, pushing designers, contractors and homeowners into a financial crunch as rising costs create chaos in the supply chain.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThat uncertainty has made it harder for businesses to plan and for customers to commit.\n\nThe U.S. home remodeling market is still expected to grow in the coming years, according to fresh projections from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).\n\nThe NAHB forecasts a 5% increase in residential remodeling activity for 2025, showing resilience in the face of economic and trade policy volatility. The growth, they say, is being driven by factors like aging housing, high home equity levels and an aging demographic.\n\nBut despite the projections, professionals like Esslinger say the lack of clarity is causing delays.\n\n\u201cThe word that just keeps coming up is uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had some clients say they\u2019re going to hold off for a little bit and see how things go, while some have scaled back a little bit.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is seeing the same level of impact.\n\nNina Sepiashvily, who runs I&N Builders in New York City, says that while she\u2019s noticed a slight uptick in costs, it\u2019s nothing compared to the price surges triggered by post-pandemic inflation. Her focus is more on structural materials like lumber, rather than imported furnishings.\n\nTariffs on Canadian lumber, a key import for the U.S., sit at 14.5%, but the U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed more than doubling that rate to 34.5%.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really seen [tariffs] affect our costs yet,\u201d Sepiashvily said, \u201cHomeowners are uncertain about tariffs, they\u2019re uncertain about their investments and they\u2019re afraid to pull the trigger.\u201d\n\nBut in New Mexico, interior decorator Sandy Schargel experienced the ripple effects firsthand when a lighting company canceled a large order due to tariff-related product discontinuations. Replacement options came with a 10% markup.\n\nSchargel says the loss of access to more affordable imported items means she now often looks to American-made alternatives in a shift that may drive up costs for budget-conscious clients.\n\n\u201cWhen you come to the lower price points, American-made does limit things, somewhat,\u201d she said. \u201cImported merchandise often has lower price options.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s now telling her clients to buy early.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told people to order what they need as soon as possible to avoid prices going up further down the line,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for Esslinger, he hasn\u2019t seen any price relief.\n\n\u201cNo home goods importers I work with have said they plan to lower prices,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: This is how American car dealers use the '4-square method\u2019 to make big profits off you \u2014 and how you can ensure you pay a fair price for all your vehicle costs\n\nTips for home renos during a tariff squeeze\n\nIf you're planning a home renovation in 2025, you're likely feeling the squeeze of rising material costs and ongoing tariff volatility. But, with the right strategy, you can still make your dream remodel a reality without blowing your budget.\n\nHere are four ways to protect your wallet and stay on track:\n\n1. Build a budget with wiggle room\n\nRenovation costs can escalate quickly in today\u2019s market. Experts recommend adding a 15% to 30% contingency to your budget to account for unexpected costs, like price hikes in materials. Use budgeting tools, whether spreadsheets or apps, to monitor every dollar spent and keep your project from spiralling out of control.\n\n2. Source materials closer to home\n\nGlobal supply chains remain unpredictable, and tariffs are making some imports pricier than ever. You can choose U.S. lumber or steel, which tend to be less tariff-sensitive. You can also work with local suppliers to cut down on shipping costs.\n\n3. Explore financing options\n\nRenovations are a big-ticket item, but there are smart ways to finance them, like home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans, which offer fixed-rate options or personal loans, if you have strong credit and want to avoid tapping into home equity.\n\n4. Get multiple, detailed bids\n\nDon\u2019t settle for the first contractor you meet. Make sure to get multiple bids and ask for itemized estimates to see exactly how much is being allocated to materials, labor and overhead. This can help you spot markups, negotiate better rates and make informed comparisons.\n\nWhile the pause in the highest tariffs offers some relief, many in the home renovation business are preparing for continued volatility.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

No, it\u2019s not illness or unemployment. It\u2019s your parent.\n\nEven if you\u2019re on top of your finances, their behavior can affect you. While parents typically have the best of intentions, they\u2019re also human. If they\u2019re not the most financially savvy, it could have far-reaching consequences on your finances.\n\nAt the time you co-signed on the car loan with your mom, you didn\u2019t know any better and probably believed that this move would help build your credit, when you had none.\n\nBut it looks like instead of paying the loan, your mom may have used her paycheck to go shopping instead.\n\nHere\u2019s what this means and what you can do to fix this situation.\n\nWhat this means and what you can do\n\nWhen you co-sign a loan, you are telling the lender that you agree to be responsible for the debt. If the borrower can\u2019t repay the loan and associated fees, you will need to, or it could hurt your credit score. If the loan goes into default, the car could be repossessed, and that negative mark will show up on your credit report since the credit bureaus will report the car loan as yours.\n\nAccording to Equifax, \u201cOnce they're recorded on your credit reports, [car repossessions] can impact your credit scores for up to seven years. Credit behaviors that typically lead to a repossession, such as missed payments and defaulted loans, may also result in negative marks on your credit reports.\u201d\n\nWith a low credit score, it could be difficult to qualify for a loan like a mortgage. Even if you could, you may be limited in your options. Lenders may not offer you the most competitive interest rates. You could pay more in interest charges, costing you tens of thousands of dollars or more throughout the life of your mortgage.\n\nYou may also have to pay higher car insurance premiums with a lower credit score.\n\nYou can get caught up on your mom\u2019s car loan or contact the lender and negotiate a repayment plan to avoid a default. This could cost you thousands of dollars \u2014 money that you may be saving for goals like getting married and purchasing a home.", "publish_ts": 1748345640000, "source": "Yahoo Finance"}

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Retail Dive newsletter.\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWhile prestige beauty industry sales were flat in the first quarter, mass-market beauty sales saw a 3% bump, a recent Circana report found.\n\nCircana attributes the sales growth to an increase in prices, because mass market unit sales still dipped 1% in the quarter. However, the change marks the first time in several years that mass-market beauty sales growth has surpassed prestige, according to the report.\n\nThough the prestige skin care category saw a 3% dip in sales, its mass counterpart grew in Q1. Meanwhile, prestige hair care products drove a 4% increase in sales among prestige beauty brands and grew by single digits for mass-market brands, Circana said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nTimes have changed for the beauty market.\n\nIn 2023, the mass-market beauty industry grew 6% year over year, while prestige beauty brands were up 14%, according to a previous Circana report. The trend continued into 2024 with consumers buying more luxury beauty items, such as fragrances and lipsticks, in the first five months of that year, according to an Adobe Analytics report released last June.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, though, shoppers pulled back on prestige purchases. The flattening of prestige beauty sales in Q1 was largely due to consumer pullback in January, according to Circana, and trends improved in both February and March, with all prestige beauty categories recording growth in March.\n\n\u201cThe beauty industry will continue to stabilize following its tremendous growth streak in prestige, even as some categories such as fragrance will continue to surge,\u201d Larissa Jensen, global beauty industry adviser at Circana, said in a statement. \u201cThe macro landscape of 2025 presents a complex mix of factors that will shape industry dynamics.\u201d\n\nJensen noted in the face of such challenges, brands must create value beyond price, have a compelling value proposition and focus on high-margin innovations.\n\nThe beauty industry is expected to grow in the coming years, but some major retailers might lose market share during that period. A TD Cowen report projects that the beauty industry will grow at a compound annual growth rate of about 5% between 2025 and 2030. However, TD Cowen also predicts that Sephora, Ulta and Sally Beauty will collectively lose about 1% of their market share by 2030.\n\nIn recent quarters, Ulta\u2019s sales have taken a hit. In its Q4 earnings report, the company said its net sales dipped by 2% to $3.5 billion, driven in part by one fewer week in the fiscal year.

He warned against simply looking through the impact of a potential supply side shock.\n\n\"It may take months or years for negotiations to fully conclude, and there could be tit-for-tat tariff increases as trading partners respond to one other,\" he said.\n\nThis week's release of the April personal consumption expenditures update - the Fed's favored inflation gauge - will be monitored closely.\n\nU.S. markets return amid a sweep of economic updates, including durable goods orders for April and consumer confidence readings for May.\n\nMeanwhile, tech investors are turning to the big earnings event of the week. Shares of semiconductor industry bellwether Nvidia gained 2.8% as the company is slated to report quarterly earnings after markets close on Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, Trump Media & Technology Group advanced 10% after a media report said Trump's social media firm planned to raise about $3 billion to spend on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\nNow to today's deep dive, where I explore how declining investor appetite for long-duration debt could stress government funding markets.\n\nLong bond blues stress the 'bedrock'\n\nBonds had a bruising week recently and investor aversion to long-dated government debt appears to be rising.\n\nAnxiety over U.S. debts and deficits took center stage as Trump's fiscal bill passed the House of Representatives - potentially adding another $3.8 trillion to the $36 trillion debt pile over the coming decade.\n\nBut mountainous government debts across major economies and unpredictable inflation, amplified by unfolding trade wars, fuel uncertainty over the central bank interest rate horizon.\n\nAt the same time, central banks continue to reduce the huge holdings of government debt accumulated over the past 15 years, particularly during the pandemic.\n\nThese developments require private investors to take up the growing slack at a nervy time, even as many of these investors are increasingly price-sensitive and wary of long-duration bonds.\n\nMany non-bank private investors embrace long-duration debt. This includes pension and insurance funds that crave steady long-term income streams from relatively safe government credits in order to match their long-term liabilities.\n\nOthers, such as mutual funds or hedge funds, may be less willing to absorb outsized price risks.\n\nAnd as exchange-traded funds that track long-term Treasuries show, it's been a dire few years.\n\nThe iShares ETF of U.S. Treasuries with remaining maturities of 20 years or more is down 3.5% for the year so far, almost as much as the loss in Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq equity index.\n\nIt has now halved in price since it peaked during the pandemic and is down 30% from the eve of the COVID outbreak.\n\nWhile \"terming out\" government debt to longer maturities has long been seen as a prudent practice to reduce roll-over risks with too much short-dated borrowing, this strategy may now contain frailties of its own due to shifts in the investor base.\n\nWith economic and policy uncertainties rife, attention is shifting toward private investor commitment and market stability.\n\nMARKET BEDROCK\n\nThe International Monetary Fund last week highlighted potential risks to the functioning of government bond markets that policymakers need to address to protect what is called \"the bedrock of capital markets\".\n\nIn a piece that focused on liquidity risks and the smooth pricing of a market covering some $80 trillion of core government debt, it pointed out how bank dealers continue to play a critical role and have expanded sovereign bond holdings.\n\nBut it said that the rise in bank dealers' core sovereign debt had not kept pace with the growth of outstanding bonds.\n\nThe stock of U.S. Treasury securities grew nearly fourfold in the 15 years through 2023, for example, but U.S. bank-dealer balance sheets expanded by just 1.5 times.\n\nNow, U.S. Treasury securities account for almost 70% of primary dealers' securities inventories - the highest share in over a decade - and about three-quarters of their securities financing is also collateralized by Treasuries.\n\n\"The challenge is that dealers' internal limits on concentrated holdings could curtail intermediation activities, especially in times of stress,\" the IMF blog noted.\n\nThat leaves the other non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) to supplement the role of market makers.\n\n\"However, because they (NBFIs) have a generally weaker mandate to support government bond markets compared to bank-dealers, they may also quickly curb activities during times of market stress,\" the IMF piece said.\n\n\"The increasing presence of NBFIs makes market resilience more uncertain and opaque because they tend to be less regulated and subject to fewer data reporting requirements.\"\n\nThe IMF then goes on to urge governments to ensure more \"structural resilience\" via more central clearing, more timely, consistent and comprehensive data on market pricing and transactions and better information on NBFIs' soundness and reliability in times of stress.\n\nTo be sure, bond markets appear to be clearing well despite the outsize policy upheavals under way. But few doubt that there are difficult moments ahead and stress at the \"bedrock\" could be seismic.\n\nChart of the day\n\nEurope's STOXX 600 index stock index lost 1% on Friday after Trump threatened to impose 50% import duties on Europe from June 1, but has since recouped all of that after he said he was postponing them and continuing negotiations. The euro gained regardless and hit its highest in three weeks on Monday before falling somewhat today.\n\nThe United States was the European Union's biggest export partner in 2024, making up 20.6% of exports, according to Eurostat. Medicinal and pharmaceutical products were the EU's most exported sector to the U.S. in 2024, followed by motor vehicles and aircraft and associated equipment, the data showed. The three largest exporters to the United States in the EU were Germany, which exported 161 billion euros ($182.62 billion) worth of goods, Ireland, at 72 billion euros, and Italy, at 65 billion euros.\n\nToday's events to watch\n\n* U.S. April durable goods orders (8:30 a.m EDT), March home prices (9:00 a.m. EDT), May consumer confidence (10:00 a.m. EDT), Dallas Federal Reserve May manufacturing survey (10:30 a.m. EDT)\n\n* Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin, New York Fed President John Williams and Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari all speak\n\n* U.S. Treasury sells $69 billion of 2-year notes\n\n* U.S. corporate earnings: Autozone\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

How Should I Structure My $890k Portfolio?", "body": "Then, estimate your likely portfolio value in retirement. Here, you are two years from retirement with $890,000 in your 401(k). Let's assume that you currently hold a mixed-asset portfolio returning 8% per year. Leaving aside any additional contributions, by retirement this portfolio could be worth around $1.04 million.\n\nAs of April 2025, the average retirement benefit is about $1,976 per month, or $23,712 per year. For the sake of this example, we'll assume that's what you can expect. So if you begin collecting at age 67, when you retire, you\u2019ll receive about $23,712 per year in Social Security. If you defer benefits, they\u2019ll increase for each month you defer, up to $29,402 per year (124% of your full benefits) starting at age 70.\n\nLet\u2019s start with your likely Social Security benefits. You can use SmartAsset's calculator to get a good idea of what to expect. Or, if you have more time, you can use the Social Security Administration's website to see the current status of your credits and benefits. Either way, get a sense of what you\u2019ll likely receive.\n\nBefore you decide how to structure your portfolio, first get a sense of your overall financial position in retirement.\n\nYou can also consider consulting with a financial advisor , who can offer personalized advice based on your individual situation.\n\nManaging your money in retirement is all about understanding this new risk profile and making strategic tax plans ahead of time. For example, say that you have $890,000 in a 401(k) . You're 65 years old and retiring in two years to capture full Social Security benefits . How should you structure your portfolio? Here are some things to think about it.\n\nDuring your working years, that plan generally involves time and income. If your portfolio takes losses, you can often wait the market out and keep investing with earned income. In retirement, that generally isn't an option. Your income is generated from the portfolio, and you\u2019re most likely not going to be putting any new money into that portfolio once you stop working.\n\nSo the question is, how will you manage the risk that comes with generating an income stream?\n\nThis is one of the key questions when it comes to managing your portfolio in retirement. Your income will be determined in large part by how much growth your portfolio generates, but investing for more growth means accepting more risk. Investing for security, on the other hand, comes with less risk, but is also associated with lower average returns.\n\nSmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThose are the funds we're working with. At age 67, when you're ready to retire, you might have about $23,712 per year in Social Security benefits and just about $1 million in your 401(k) under these assumptions.\n\nA financial advisor can help you make projections for retirement based on your own assumptions.\n\nWhat Structure Should You Use?\n\nThe next question is, how should you structure this portfolio?\n\nOnce you retire, you have several options for holding your money. In theory you can withdraw everything from your tax-advantaged retirement accounts and put it all into a taxed portfolio. However, you\u2019ll likely lose money with this choice, either to up-front withdrawal taxes, long-term opportunity costs or both.\n\nInstead, you generally have four common choices:\n\n1. Keep Your Employer-Sponsored Account\n\nIf your retirement account is in an employer-sponsored program, you can usually leave it right where it is once you retire. You can't add new money to this account, even from earned income, but you can begin taking withdrawals. Your employer will manage this portfolio, and will charge you any associated fees. When it's worth less than $7,000, you\u2019ll need to empty the account.\n\nHere, for example, you\u2019ll likely have about $1 million in a 401(k) when you retire at age 67. If you choose, you can leave that money in your 401(k) plan and let your employer continue to manage it on your behalf.\n\n2. Hold Your Assets in a Pre-Tax IRA\n\nYou can also choose to hold your assets in an individual retirement account. There are many different versions of pre-tax IRAs, but they all offer the same broad structure. This is money on which you have not yet paid income taxes. You manage the portfolio and its investments on your own, and then you pay income taxes on the full amount when you withdraw it.\n\nIf you hold your money in an employer-sponsored portfolio, like a 401(k), you can roll it all over to a traditional IRA when you retire. There are no taxes on this move. While you\u2019ll no longer pay employer-management fees, you will pay any fees associated with any specific assets you buy.\n\n3. Hold Your Assets in a Post-Tax Roth IRA\n\nYou can also choose to hold your assets in a Roth IRA. This is a post-tax retirement account, meaning that you must pay full income taxes on any money you invest. However, when you withdraw the money, it is entirely untaxed. This means that you don't pay any taxes on your retirement portfolio's growth, and your withdrawals won't count toward your taxable income.\n\nIf you have money in a traditional IRA or an employer-sponsored portfolio like a 401(k), you can make a Roth conversion, meaning you can move money from the pre-tax portfolio to the Roth IRA. However, you must pay income taxes on the entire amount converted in the year you make the conversion. This makes a near-retirement Roth conversion very expensive, and sometimes a long-term money loser for retirees.\n\n4. Hold Your Assets in an Annuity\n\nAnother option is to roll assets into a lifetime annuity. These are contracts, typically sold by life insurance companies, that guarantee monthly payments for the rest of your life. In exchange, you make an initial up-front investment.\n\nThe major upside to an annuity is security. Short of catastrophic bankruptcy, your retirement payments are ensured for life. The major downsides are twofold:\n\nFirst, you have no control over this money. You cannot manage the account or pursue more growth in an up market (although you are free to invest the annuity payments in a taxed portfolio). Second, most annuities issue fixed payments, so you have no hedge against inflation.\n\nHere, for example, you expect to have about $1 million by retirement age. A representative annuity might pay you about $7,100 per month, or about $85,000 per year. Just make sure to prepare for price erosion.\n\nHow Should You Invest?\n\nIf you hold your money in an IRA or a Roth IRA, your next question is how to invest it. This is another area where a financial advisor can help.\n\nManaging money in retirement isn't just about keeping it safe. Retirements are getting longer. The average retiree lives to between ages 85 and 87 and, since this is just the average life expectancy, about half of retirees should expect to live longer. So it's wise to plan for about 30 years in retirement. You\u2019ll need to build wealth to pay for those years, which means investing for at least some amount of growth.\n\nThis brings us back to the question of risk tolerance, and how you plan to manage any risk you are exposed to in retirement.\n\nIf your portfolio takes losses, can you adjust your lifestyle to take less income? Can you draw on other assets? Can you use excess withdrawals to build up an emergency fund? The more you can adjust for losses, the more volatility and risk you can accept in your portfolio.\n\nFor example, let's take three possible profiles for how you could invest your 401(k) in retirement:\n\nAll Corporate Bonds, Average Yield 5%\n\nAnnual Income for 30 Years: Approximately $64,000\n\nPros and Cons: High security, but low returns\n\nHalf Bonds/Half Stocks, Average Return 8%\n\nAnnual Income for 30 Years: Approximately $85,000\n\nPros and Cons: A mixed approach with a middle ground between security and returns\n\nS&P 500 Fund, Average Yield 11%\n\nAnnual Income for 30 Years: Approximately $107,000\n\nPros and Cons: Strong income, but with lots of volatility\n\nYou can see the clear differences. The more volatility and risk you can adapt to, the more income you can generate from your portfolio. But those returns come at a cost, so the more risk you accept in your portfolio, the more flexibility you\u2019ll need to accept losses in a down year. How you should structure your portfolio in retirement will depend on this question.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAt 65, retirement is right on the horizon. When it comes to planning for this, one of the most important issues to consider is how you\u2019ll manage risk and loses in your savings.\n\nTips on Risk Management\n\nA financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nWhen you build a risk management plan, one of the best places to start is with what's called a \"risk profile.\" This is your overall approach to risk, and how you will adapt to losses when they occur.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid \u2014 in an account that isn\u2019t at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nAre you a financial advisor looking to grow your business?

These jobs have the potential to lift people out of poverty.\u201d\n\nIn the survey of 1,000 hiring managers, 84% of companies that recently removed degree requirements said it has been a successful move. Companies without degree requirements also reported a surge in applications, a more diverse applicant pool and the ability to offer lower salaries.\n\nAmong employers that eliminated degree requirements, two-thirds did so for entry-level roles, 54% for mid-level roles and 23% for senior-level roles. About half of hiring managers said \u201ca lot\u201d of their roles still require a bachelor\u2019s degree, while 1% said none do.\n\nForty-two percent of hiring managers said Generation Z should prioritize gaining job experience over a degree. Hiring managers also said practical skills related to artificial intelligence tools and soft skills, such as strong interpersonal and communication skills, are important.\n\nMany Gen Z job seekers say AI has made their college degrees irrelevant, according to an Indeed report. The ongoing push to eliminate college degree requirements has led half of Gen Z workers to view their degrees as a waste of time and money, the report found.\n\nTo expand access to jobs and reduce reliance on degrees, California has announced a plan to launch \u201ccareer passports\u201d to encourage job access. Gov.

This model will expand our product portfolio beyond the EH216 series in urban air mobility, enabling broader application scenarios in long-range regional air mobility in the future.

We are confident in our ability to shape the future of air mobility and maintain our leadership in this sector.\u201d Conor Yang, Chief Financial Officer of EHang, added: \u201cIn the first quarter of 2025, we recorded a revenue decline, primarily due to the timing of customer procurement plans aligning with the issuance of the first OCs at the end of March.

{"url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/mortgages/article/heloc-to-pay-off-debt-173921959.html", "title": "How to use a HELOC to pay off debt (and when it makes sense)", "body": "Are you overwhelmed by credit cards, personal loans, or medical bills? Depending on your financial situation, using a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay off debt could be a smart move.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to understand how paying off or consolidating debt with a HELOC works to decide if it makes sense for you.\n\nHELOC: What is it, and how does it work?\n\nA HELOC is a line of credit drawn from the equity in your home. It functions like a credit card with a revolving line of credit, unlike a traditional mortgage or personal loan, which gives you a lump sum of money. A HELOC gives you access to money for just about anything, such as large purchases, home improvements, or debt consolidation.\n\nMost HELOCs have variable interest rates, although some lenders offer fixed-rate HELOC options. HELOC annual percentage rates (APRs) are typically much lower than credit card rates. So, while they have some of the same features as a credit card, they can be more affordable and actually help you pay off credit card debt.\n\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n\nHow to use a HELOC to pay off debt\n\nTo pay off debt with a HELOC, you need to understand how to qualify and what rules you have to follow. Here are the basics on getting a HELOC and using the funds to pay off other debts.\n\nHave enough home equity\n\nHELOC lenders typically look for homeowners with 15% to 20% equity in their house. Equity is your home\u2019s value minus your outstanding mortgage balance. That means you\u2019re more likely to get approved if your mortgage balance is 80% to 85% less than your home\u2019s appraised value. For example, if an appraiser claims your home is worth $400,000, your outstanding mortgage principal should be a maximum of $320,000 to $340,000. If your balance is higher, you won\u2019t qualify for a HELOC.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to meet basic borrower requirements, such as having a good credit score, a low debt-to-income ratio, stable income, and a history of on-time payments.\n\nKnow how a HELOC works\n\nThere are two main phases of a HELOC.\n\nThe draw period: You can access as much or as little of the line of credit the lender approved you for during the draw period, which usually lasts up to 10 years. During this time, you\u2019re typically required to make minimum interest-only payments on the amount you withdraw (though you can pay more). During this period, you can draw money as needed to pay off medical debt, credit card bills, or other significant debt payments.\n\nThe repayment period: In the repayment period, your minimum payment will increase to cover both interest and principal until you\u2019ve paid off the balance. The repayment period usually lasts for 20 years, and you can no longer draw money during this time.\n\nUnderstand the risks\n\nHELOCs are secured loans that use your home as collateral. Secured loans are considered less risky for lenders because if a borrower can\u2019t repay the debt, the lender can seize the home.\n\nSecured loans can be riskier for borrowers, though. If you struggle to afford monthly payments on both your HELOC and original mortgage, your home could go into foreclosure. So, while a HELOC can help you get out of debt, only consider this option if you\u2019re confident you can keep up with the loan payments. You don\u2019t want to lose your house in an attempt to pay off unsecured debt, such as a credit card or personal loan.\n\nGo deeper: Best HELOC lenders of May 2025\n\nAdvantages of using a HELOC to pay off debt\n\nThere are several benefits to a HELOC, especially if you\u2019re dealing with high-interest debt. Here are a few pros to consider.\n\nLower interest rates: HELOC interest rates can be lower than those for credit cards or other unsecured loans, like personal loans. Using a lower-interest line of credit to pay off higher-interest debt will save you money on interest payments.\n\nAffordable payments: For the first decade or so, you can typically make interest-only payments on your HELOC. This can be more affordable than the minimum payments for other borrowing methods.\n\nMay improve credit utilization: Credit utilization refers to the percentage of your available credit you\u2019re using. The lower your utilization ratio, the better. For example, it\u2019s better for your credit score if you owe $1,000 on your credit card with a $10,000 limit than if you owe $9,000. The FICO credit score model doesn\u2019t usually include HELOCs when calculating credit utilization. (However, other scoring models might.)\n\nStreamlined payments: Simplifying from multiple credit card payments to one HELOC payment could make it easier to manage your finances.\n\nDisadvantages of using a HELOC to pay off debt\n\nBefore using a HELOC to pay off other loans, consider these potential downsides.\n\nRequires enough home equity: You may have a hard time qualifying for a HELOC if you don\u2019t have at least 15% equity in your home.\n\nMay come with closing costs: If the lender charges closing costs, you could pay 2% to 5% of the credit limit.\n\nVariable interest rates: Repaying a variable-rate HELOC can be difficult to budget since the payment can change periodically.\n\nDefaulting can risk home foreclosure: Your home is collateral with a HELOC, so if you have trouble repaying, the lender can repossess your home. There can be consequences for not repaying your credit card, personal loan, or student loan bills, but because these are types of unsecured debt, companies cannot take away things like your home.\n\nWhen it makes sense to pay off debt with a HELOC\n\nLower interest rates are one of the biggest advantages of a HELOC, making it a solid option for people with high-interest debt.\n\n\u201cAnytime you can consolidate debt by rolling into a loan with a lower interest rate, it can put you in a better financial position,\u201d said Dre Torres, loan officer at Cornerstone First Mortgage, via email. \u201cSavings from a HELOC can help you have a positive monthly cash flow or pay down other debts.\u201d\n\nHowever, struggling to repay a HELOC has serious consequences.\n\n\u201cA HELOC is tied to your home, so it\u2019s not something you want to take lightly. Make sure you are financially diligent and don\u2019t get back into debt,\u201d noted Torres. \u201cIf you lack a solid budget or have poor spending habits, a HELOC is generally a bad idea.\n\nThere are other ways to consolidate debt if a HELOC is not right for you.\n\nHome equity loan: Access your home\u2019s equity in a lump sum, typically repaid at a fixed interest rate.\n\nCash-out refinance: Refinance for more than your existing mortgage if you have enough equity. Take the difference in cash and use it to pay off debt.\n\nPersonal loan: You can borrow a lump sum to consolidate or pay off higher-interest debt and repay it at a fixed rate, usually within five to seven years.\n\nCredit card balance transfer: Transferring high-interest debt to a credit card with 0% APR could save you money if you can pay off the balance before the no-interest period ends. You typically need good to excellent credit to qualify.\n\nCredit counseling programs: Some nonprofit agencies can help you negotiate more affordable payments with your creditors if you\u2019re struggling to stay current.\n\nHow to use a HELOC to pay off debt FAQs\n\nIs it a good idea to use a HELOC to pay off debt?\n\nUsing a HELOC to pay off debt can be a good idea if you have high-interest credit card debt. HELOCs tend to have lower rates than credit cards because they\u2019re secured by your home. But that also means you could lose your home if you struggle to repay the balance.\n\nHow does a HELOC affect your credit?\n\nA HELOC typically shows up on your credit report as revolving credit. As with other credit accounts, missing payments can hurt your score. A HELOC can also impact your credit utilization. While FICO doesn\u2019t include a HELOC in your utilization calculation, other credit score models might.\n\nShould I use a HELOC or home equity loan to pay off debt?\n\nYou can use a HELOC or home equity loan to pay off high-interest debt. Both use your home as collateral. HELOCs usually come with variable interest rates. Home equity loans have fixed rates, making them more predictable. Your HELOC payments could be more affordable if you choose interest-only payments during the draw period. However, your payments will increase significantly when the draw period ends.\n\nRead more: HELOC vs. home equity loan \u2014 Choose the right one for you\n\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article.", "publish_ts": 1748367561000, "source": "Yahoo Finance"}

The more money you keep in your account, and the longer you hold it there, the more you stand to earn thanks to compound interest.\n\nFor example, if you deposited $1,000 into a 4% interest savings account that compounds interest daily and left the money there for one year, you'd earn a total of $40 in interest (assuming you don't make any additional contributions).\n\nLet's say you deposited $10,000. At the end of the year, you'd earn $400 in interest. And if you made an additional $100 contribution each month, you'd end up with $421.84 in interest earnings.\n\nHow to maximize 4% interest on a savings account\n\nFinding a savings account that pays 4% on your balance is a great way to give your savings a boost and help it grow over time. However, there are additional steps you can take to get the most value out of your account.\n\nStart with a higher principal balance: The more money you deposit initially, the more interest you earn from the start.\n\nContribute regularly: Consider setting up automatic transfers to the savings account. Even small, consistent deposits can make a big difference over time. If you contribute $100 monthly \u2014 that\u2019s an extra $1,200 per year that earns 4% interest, which compounds to grow even more.\n\nTake advantage of compound interest: Make sure the interest on your account compounds at least monthly, if not daily. The more frequently interest is compounded, the more your money will grow.\n\nKeep your money in the account: Each time you withdraw funds from your savings account, the principal balance that earns interest decreases, which reduces the overall growth potential. A checking account or money market account may be a better fit for money you need for daily spending or paying bills.\n\nWatch out for fees: Look for a savings account with no monthly maintenance fees or other charges that could eat into your interest. Some high-yield accounts have minimum balance requirements to avoid fees or earn the highest advertised rate, so be sure you can meet those minimums \u2014 or choose an account with no minimum balance requirement.\n\nSee our picks for the 10 best high-yield savings accounts\n\nHow long will 4% interest rates on savings accounts last?\n\nSavings accounts that offer 4% are becoming increasingly hard to find. Recent rate cuts by the Federal Reserve signal that the economy is moving in the right direction, but they also mean deposit account rates are on the decline.\n\nAdditional rate cuts could be on the horizon, so it pays to take advantage of an account with a higher rate while it lasts.\n\nFor those looking to maximize their savings, it might be wise to take advantage of current rates while they remain elevated. If you want to lock in today's higher rates, you may want to consider a certificate of deposit (CD) instead of a high-yield savings account.", "publish_ts": 1717523581000, "source": "Yahoo Finance"}

That\u2019s especially true for credit card debt balances , which today carry interest rates upwards of 21% APR on average.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to take control of existing debt, you can use a balance transfer credit card to save money and time throughout the payoff process.\n\nHow to lower your debt with a balance transfer card\n\nBalance transfer credit cards offer an introductory APR on transferred debt balances \u2014 usually 0% APR for several months after account opening. When you transfer a balance to these cards, you can use the intro period to pay down your balance without accruing additional interest.\n\nBalance transfer intro periods today typically range between 12 and 18 months or even longer. You\u2019ll often incur a fee for the transfer of 3% to 5% of your balance, but that\u2019s much less than you\u2019d pay in interest.\n\nFor example, say you have a $6,000 balance on a card charging a 22% APR and you transfer that balance to a card with a 0% APR for 15 months plus a 3% balance transfer fee.\n\nIf you can make payments of $412 per month, you can pay the balance in full over the intro period, including the fee. With that same $412 payment on your existing card, you\u2019d pay off your $6,000 balance in a slightly longer 18 months but take on an additional $1,044 in interest over that period.\n\nEven accounting for the balance transfer fee, you could save $864 and three months in this scenario.\n\nHave a plan before you open a balance transfer card so you can pay down as much as possible over the intro period. Any amount left over when the 0% APR period ends will start to accrue interest at the card\u2019s ongoing APR \u2014 which could quickly lead you back to mounting debt balances.\n\nBecause a balance transfer typically requires you to open a new credit card account , you should also consider whether you can qualify. You\u2019ll typically need good-to-excellent credit , and the issuer will conduct a hard credit check before you\u2019re approved.\n\nView your credit score before you submit your application to get an idea of how likely you are to qualify or see if you prequalify.\n\nLearn more: How to check your credit score for free\n\nHow to choose a balance transfer credit card\n\nTo start the balance transfer process, you\u2019ll need to choose the right card . Here are some of the most important details to consider when choosing a balance transfer card.\n\nIssuer restrictions\n\nMany banks will not approve balance transfers from credit cards or loans they issued, so you should look for balance transfer cards from a different bank or lender than you already have.\n\nIn other words, you probably won\u2019t be able to transfer a balance from your Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card account to a Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae, or from a Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card to a Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card.\n\n0% APR introductory period\n\nThe introductory 0% APR period may be the most important factor in choosing the best credit card for your balance transfer. Today, these offers range from around 12 months up to 21 months.\n\nIf you have a relatively small debt balance, you may opt for a shorter introductory APR offer in exchange for other ongoing benefits and rewards you\u2019ll use long-term.\n\nFor example, say you have a $2,000 balance on an existing card. If you choose a balance transfer card with a 0% APR for 15 months and ongoing cash-back rewards , you could pay less than $150 per month to pay off the balance in full over that intro period. After the introductory offer, you can continue to save using the card\u2019s rewards on your spending.\n\nBalance transfer cards with the longest intro periods tend to have fewer ongoing perks \u2014 but these cards may be better if you have a large balance so you have as much time as possible to pay down your debt.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re considering the same 15-month 0% APR balance transfer card, but you carry a much higher $8,000 balance. To pay it off in full over the intro period, you\u2019ll now need to pay over $500 each month. But with a balance transfer card with a 21-month intro period, you can lower your monthly payments to $380 and still pay the balance in full over the intro period.\n\nRead more: What is a balance transfer and how does it work?\n\nBalance transfer fee\n\nBalance transfer fees can add to your overall cost, depending on the card you choose. In most cases, fee charges are around 3% to 5% of your overall balance.\n\nIf you transfer $5,000 in debt, for example, to a balance transfer card with a 3% fee, you\u2019ll add $150 to your overall balance.\n\nFees are never a welcome addition, but keep that added cost in perspective. For most balance transfers, a 3% to 5% fee is only going to add up to a few hundred dollars to your total debt. Meanwhile, you could save thousands of dollars in interest charges with a balance transfer, even after accounting for the fee.\n\nLearn more: The best balance transfer credit cards of 2025\n\nHow to use a balance transfer card in 4 steps\n\nBalance transfers can require some upfront work beyond applying for a new card. Follow these steps to start lowering your debt using a balance transfer.\n\n1. Initiate your balance transfer\n\nTo take full advantage of the intro period, start your transfer sooner rather than later.\n\nSome balance transfer cards allow you to initiate your transfer when you apply. For example, the Chase Freedom Unlimited card application lets you add up to three existing accounts to transfer balances from upon approval. If you choose to start the process this way, you\u2019ll usually have a period (10 days in this case) after your card is mailed to you to change or cancel your transfer request.\n\nIf you don\u2019t make your transfer request when you apply, you\u2019ll need to contact the credit card company after your account is opened. Call the number on the back of your card or look for more information within your online account.\n\n2. Know the balance transfer terms\n\nWhen you\u2019re making your balance transfer request, look for the fee details within your card terms. You can use that to calculate your fee based on your balance and avoid any surprises on your statement after the transfer is approved.\n\nYou can also use your card\u2019s terms to determine how much you\u2019re able to transfer. This usually depends on the credit limit you\u2019re approved for.\n\nFor example, say you have a $9,000 balance to transfer and you\u2019re approved for a $9,000 credit line \u2014 but your card carries a 5% balance transfer fee. The fee itself will add $450 to your total balance, so you\u2019ll need to account for that when you request your transfer.\n\nLook for restrictions on your transferred balance, especially if you wait to request the transfer. Some cards, for instance, require you transfer your balance within a certain number of days after account opening to qualify for the intro APR. Others may increase the balance transfer fee after a certain time period. You can usually find any restrictions that may apply within the card agreement.\n\n3. Wait for approval\n\nYou\u2019ll probably have to wait a few weeks for your balance transfer to process. Don\u2019t forget to keep paying your original credit card bill during this time. Make at least minimum payments toward your balance by the due date to avoid late or missed payments .\n\nAfter you\u2019re approved, your balance transfer credit card issuer will typically pay off your existing balance, and that amount will transfer to the new card. Make sure to double-check that the old balance is paid and the transfer went through before you make any changes or stop payments to your existing account.\n\n4. Start paying your balance\n\nAfter approval, the countdown on your introductory rate begins. At this stage, you should already have a plan in place for using your balance transfer card to pay down debt.\n\nFor one, think about how much you can afford to pay each month. Ideally, aim to pay down the balance in full throughout the intro period. But if that amount is beyond your budget, determine a fixed monthly payment you can afford, or just commit to paying down as much as possible over the intro period.\n\nNo matter what, always make your payments on time so you can keep your credit in good standing and avoid any additional fees \u2014 or even losing your 0% APR offer.\n\nRemember, a balance transfer is only a tool; lowering your debt still takes work. Commit to budgeting for your payments and reducing your debt as much as possible while you\u2019re not accruing interest, and you can start to make big strides toward becoming debt-free over this period.\n\nIs a balance transfer the best way to lower your debt?\n\nFor many people, a balance transfer credit card can offer a cost-effective path to debt payoff.\n\nIt may not be the solution for everyone, though. If you have a very high balance or balances across multiple cards, your debt could exceed your balance transfer card\u2019s credit limit , leaving you unable to transfer the entire balance. In this case, you may want to consider a personal loan for debt payoff. Great debt consolidation loans can offer lower interest rates than credit cards, with fixed monthly payments and minimal fees.\n\nA balance transfer may not be a good option if you\u2019re unwilling or unable to make significant payments toward your debt. After the intro period ends, you\u2019ll start accruing interest at the card\u2019s ongoing APR \u2014 which may be just as steep as your current interest rate . Balance transfers work best if you can pay down a significant amount of your debt within the limited introductory period.\n\nYou may also want to reconsider a balance transfer if you have ongoing issues with overspending on your credit cards. Make sure you can commit to paying down your debt without adding more to your balance. Otherwise, you could end the promotional period with a higher balance than you started.\n\nStill, many cardholders with high-interest debt balances can benefit from a balance transfer credit card. If you have a repayment plan in place, choose the right 0% APR period and fee structure, and make a timely transfer request, you can use your balance transfer card to lower your debt without letting interest set you back.\n\nThe best balance transfer credit cards\n\nHere are a few of our top-rated balance transfer credit cards that you can use to pay down your debt and continue saving over time:\n\nIf you want long-term rewards\n\nThese cash-back credit cards can offer great value on your everyday spending in addition to introductory balance transfer offers. However, you may sacrifice a few extra months with 0% APR to earn rewards and other long-term benefits, so do the math on your debt payoff before you choose these card options.\n\nCapital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card Learn more\n\nIf you want a long 0% APR period\n\nThe cards below carry some of the longest introductory 0% APR offers on balance transfers available today.

But your feeling of accomplishment won\u2019t last if you move in and have little money for anything but maintaining that roof over your head.\n\nThat\u2019s known as being house poor, and it can create long-term financial stress and take a serious bite out of your ability to enjoy the home you worked so hard to afford. Read on to learn what it means to be house poor, the potential impacts it can have on your life, and the steps you can take to avoid \u2014 or recover from \u2014 this financial strain.\n\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n\nWhat does 'house poor' mean?\n\nBeing house poor means you\u2019re spending so much of your income on housing costs that there\u2019s not much left for anything else. These costs include things like your mortgage payment, utilities, homeowners insurance, and general maintenance. If these expenses gobble up most of your monthly income, you could struggle to pay for other living expenses, like groceries and gas, or building an emergency fund \u2014 even if you\u2019re earning a good living.\n\nBeing house poor doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re mismanaging your personal finances. It can result from buying more home than you can comfortably afford (thanks to high home prices and interest rates), underestimating the costs of homeownership, or losing your income because of a job loss or other life event.\n\nHere's an example: Say you and your spouse bought a $500,000 home with a monthly mortgage payment of $3,200. You had no problem qualifying for the mortgage thanks to a solid income. After closing, however, paying for all your monthly needs on top of your house payment, day care, utilities, groceries, and credit card bills maxes out your budget. One additional expense, like an unexpected repair, could leave you struggling financially.\n\nSigns you might be house poor\n\nHere are some warning signs that your budget is stretched to the max.\n\nBeing a homeowner is stressing you out. You constantly worry about money, repairs, or what would happen if you or your partner got laid off.\n\nYou\u2019ve stopped saving. Your emergency, retirement, and vacation savings have fallen by the wayside.\n\nYou\u2019re relying on credit cards. If you\u2019re using credit cards to cover basic expenses like groceries and utilities, that could be a red flag.\n\nThe idea of an emergency expense is terrifying. Whether it\u2019s a car repair or a medical bill, the thought of unexpected expenses can feel like a major bummer.\n\nFinancial stress piles up in other areas of your life, impacting your health and leading to mood swings, poor sleep, or even serious conditions like depression or high blood pressure. And don\u2019t discount the loss of discretionary spending \u2014 having funds for hobbies, travel, and small luxuries like a date night is an important stress-release valve.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to check all the boxes above to be house poor. Experiencing one or two of these stressors could mean it\u2019s time to reassess your housing costs.\n\nHow to avoid becoming house poor before you buy\n\nThe best time to avoid becoming house poor is before you reach the closing table. Some careful planning and conservative budgeting can help ensure your dream home doesn\u2019t become a financial nightmare.\n\nMake smart moves on the front end of homebuying\n\nBeing a savvy homebuyer will go a long way to making you a comfortable homeowner. Find a real estate agent who knows the local real estate market inside and out so you don\u2019t end up with a money pit that needs a ton of unexpected repairs or floods in every rainstorm. Take steps to shore up your financial situation to help in the borrowing phase: saving for a sizable down payment and building up your credit score, which will help you qualify for the best home loan terms and keep your monthly payment manageable.\n\nKnow your true budget \u2014 not just how much you qualify for\n\nJust because a lender approves you for a certain amount doesn\u2019t mean you need to spend it all. It\u2019s nearly impossible for lenders to factor in things like your personal spending habits, savings goals, and the little luxuries (coffee, anyone?) that make you feel secure and content. A good rule of thumb? Keep your housing costs under 28% of your gross monthly income.\n\nFactor in all of your housing expenses\n\nYour mortgage payment is only part of the housing costs picture. Be sure to factor in additional expenses like homeowners insurance, property taxes, homeowners' association (HOA) fees, and general maintenance costs each year. A home inspection can help flag structural issues that could become major expenses down the line.\n\nLeave room for life\n\nMake sure your total housing costs leave room for saving, investing, and the creature comforts that bring you and those you love joy. A slightly smaller or lower-cost home could offer some much-needed financial space to invest in your family and future.\n\nOnline house affordability and mortgage calculators can help you run the numbers to find your ideal housing expense sweet spot. You can also find online budget calculators to get a clear picture of what you can reasonably afford and what might stretch you too thin. Debt-to-income ratio is a metric many mortgage lenders (and smart budgeters) use to assess how much house you can afford.\n\nAlready feeling house poor? You have options\n\nIf you feel like you might have already reached the house-poor tipping point, don\u2019t panic. These steps can help you de-stress and regain control of your finances.\n\nReevaluate your budget\n\nTake a hard look at your budget and find areas to potentially trim. You could consider a debt consolidation loan to lower payments on high-interest debts like credit cards or limit streaming subscriptions to free up cash for housing expenses.\n\nBoost your income\n\nConsider gig work, part-time jobs, or even renting out a room in your home to bring in extra cash. Even short-term boosts to your income can provide a financial cushion.\n\nRefinance your mortgage\n\nIf rates have dropped or your credit has improved since buying your home, refinancing your mortgage could help lower your mortgage payment. Be sure to factor in closing costs before deciding on this solution.\n\nConsider downsizing\n\nIf your home has become too much of a financial stress, consider selling and moving to a more affordable space or even renting for a while. It\u2019s a major decision that could bring a sigh of relief and help build long-term financial stability.\n\nSeek financial advice\n\nTalking to a financial advisor or housing counselor could bring clarity if you're overwhelmed. HUD-approved housing counselors offer free or low-cost guidance on budgeting, mortgage relief programs, and foreclosure prevention. You can find a counselor near you through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s website.\n\nHouse poor FAQs\n\nIs there such a thing as house rich?\n\n\"House rich, cash poor\" refers to people having a large amount of equity in their home, either because they\u2019ve paid the mortgage down over the years or the home\u2019s value has appreciated quickly since they bought it. But home equity is illiquid \u2014 meaning it\u2019s not easily accessed. So if you\u2019re house rich but need cash for an emergency or to pay down debt, a home equity loan or line of credit can be a useful tool.\n\nWhat is the biggest burden on homeowners?\n\nThe biggest burden on homeowners is rising housing expenses beyond their mortgage, including insurance, property taxes, home maintenance, and utilities. Research from Harvard\u2019s Joint Centers for Housing Studies found that these expenses have increased at a faster pace since the pandemic.\n\nHow many Americans pay off their home?\n\nAccording to the most recent data from the American Community Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, 38.8% of owner-occupied units are mortgage-free, while 61.2% have an outstanding mortgage.", "publish_ts": 1748377197000, "source": "Yahoo Finance"}

That's the way they go.\"\n\nThe sweeping One Big Beautiful Bill Act is projected to raise the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that conducts economic analysis for Congress. The deficit is on track in 2025 to run close to $2 trillion, with the national debt now at $36.2 trillion.\n\n\"I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful, but I don't know if it could be both,\" Musk said in the CBS clip.\n\nTrump and congressional Republicans counter that the bill reduces spending in key areas and will generate enough growth to compensate for the tax reductions.

Gross domestic product, a sum of all the goods and services produced from January through March, fell at a 0.3% annualized pace, according to a Commerce Department report Wednesday adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation. This was the first quarter of negative growth since Q1 of 2022. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a gain of 0.4% after GDP rose by 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. However, over the past day or so some Wall Street economists changed their outlook to negative growth, largely because of an unexpected rise in imports as companies and consumers sought to get ahead of the Trump tariffs implemented in early April. Indeed, imports soared 41.3% for the quarter, driven by a 50.9% increase in goods, for the biggest growth outside the Covid pandemic since 1974. Imports subtract from GDP, so the contraction in growth may not be viewed as negatively given the potential for the trend to reverse in subsequent quarters. Imports took more than 5 percentage points off the headline reading. Exports rose 1.8%. A slowdown in consumer spending and a sharp decline in federal outlays also contributed to the weak GDP number amid Elon Musk's efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency. \"Maybe some of this negativity is due to a rush to bring in imports before the tariffs go up, but there is simply no way for policy advisors to sugar-coat this. Growth has simply vanished,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds.\n\nPeople shop in a Manhattan store on July 27, 2023 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nConsumer spending slowed during the period but was still positive. Personal consumption expenditures increased 1.8% for the period, the slowest quarterly gain since Q2 of 2023 and down from a 4% gain in the prior quarter. However, a separate report showed that spending was up 0.7% in March, higher than the 0.5% estimate. Moreover, private domestic investment soared during the period, rising 21.9%, primarily driven by a 22.5% surge in equipment spending that also could have been tariff driven. Federal government expenditures declined 5.1% for the quarter, shaving about one-third of a percentage point off GDP. The report comes ahead of the next uncertain steps for Trump's trade policy. In early April, the president announced 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. trade partners as well as a menu of select \"reciprocal\" duties against dozens of nations. On April 9, Trump suspended those duties for a 90-day negotiation period that has yet to yield results, though administration officials have indicated that some deals are near. \"No surprise that GDP took a hit in the first quarter, mainly because the balance of trade blew up as companies imported goods like crazy to front-run tariffs. The more telling number for the future of the expansion was consumer spending, and it grew, but at a relatively weak pace,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. \"That's concerning, but not alarming as it could have been due to bad weather and a spending surge at the end of last year.\" Stock market futures slipped following the report while Treasury yields moved higher. In a Truth Social post following the report, Trump did not address GDP specifically, instead referring to \"Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's.\" \"Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers,\" Trump wrote. \"Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden 'Overhang.' This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other.

Photo by Hannes P Albert/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nGerman consumer inflation came in at 2.2% in April on an annual basis, easing slightly from March levels but coming in above expectations, preliminary data showed Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had estimated a 2.1% reading. The country's consumer price index, harmonized for comparability across the euro zone, had come in at 2.3% in March on an annual basis. So-called core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, accelerated to 2.9% in April from 2.6% in March.

While the inflation rate closing in on the European Central Bank's 2% mark is good news for consumers at first glance, there are some less positive points about the data on closer look, Sebastian Becker, economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note Wednesday. The slight decrease of the headline figures only took place due to lower energy and food costs, he said. \"In comparison, the core inflation rate, which is more important for the ECB ... rose notably again.\" And services inflation appears \"considerably more stubborn than expected,\" Becker added.\n\nEconomic growth\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, preliminary data showed that Germany's economy expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter from the previous three-month period. The figure, released by the German federal statistics office, is adjusted for price, calendar and seasonal variations. The gross domestic product reading was in line with estimates from economists polled by Reuters. Germany's gross domestic had contracted by 0.2% in the fourth quarter. The statistics office attributed the quarterly increase to the fact \"that both household final consumption expenditure and capital formation were higher than in the previous quarter.\" While acknowledging Wednesday's figures were positive, \"the quarterly increase is still far too small to end the country's long-lasting stagnation,\" Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, said in a note. Europe's largest economy has long been sluggish, with its GDP flip-flopping between growth and contraction in each quarter throughout 2023 and 2024. The country has so far avoided technical recession, which is defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction. Key sectors of the economy, such as autos, have been suffering from stronger competition from China. Other industries including housebuilding and infrastructure have also been going through trying times that have been linked to higher costs, muted investment and bureaucratic hurdles. Separately, U.S President Donald Trump's tariff policies have thrust uncertainty onto export reliant Germany which counts the U.S. as its most important trading partner. As part of the European Union, Germany is facing 20% blanket tariffs on goods exported to the U.S., although these levies have been temporarily reduced to 10% to allow time for negotiations. U.S. duties on steel, aluminum and autos also affect the country. The German government last week cut its economic outlook to predict stagnation in 2025, with outgoing economy minister Robert Habeck saying Trump's trade policies and their impact on the country were the main factor behind the revision.\n\nFiscal upheaval", "publish_ts": 1745971200000, "source": "CNBC Economy"}

Searches for the \"Global Financial Crisis\" are expected to hit levels not seen since 2010, while inquiries for the \"Great Recession\" are slated to be at their highest rate since the onset of the Covid pandemic.\n\nPorkchops, house parties and jungle juice\n\nOn TikTok, a gaggle of Millennials and Gen Xers has stepped into the roles of older siblings, offering flashbacks and advice to younger people on how to pinch pennies. Some Gen Zers have put out calls to elders for insights on what a recession may feel like at this stage of life, having been too young to feel the full effects of the financial crisis. \"This is, potentially, at least on a large scale, the first time that millennials have been able to be the 'experts' on something,\" said Scott Sills, a 33-year-old marketer in Louisiana. \"We're the experts on getting the rug pulled out from under us.\" Those doling out the advice are taking a trip down memory lane the to tail-end of the aughts. Cheap getaways to Florida were the norm instead of lush trips abroad. They had folders for receipts in case big-ticket purchases went on sale later. Business casual outfits were commonplace at social events because they couldn't afford multiple styles of clothing. Porkchops were a staple dinner given their relative affordability, leading one creator to declare that they \"taste like\" the Great Recession. They drank \"jungle juice\" at house parties, a concoction of various cheap liquors and mixers, instead of cocktails at bars. \"There's things that I didn't realize were 'recession indicators' the first time around that I thought were just the trends,\" said M.A. Lakewood, a writer and professional fundraiser in upstate New York. \"Now, you can see it coming from 10 miles away.\"\n\nCustomers shop for produce at an H-E-B grocery store on Feb. 12, 2025 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty Images\n\nTo be sure, some of the discourse has centered around how inflationary pressures have made a handful of these hacks defunct. Some content creators pointed out that the federal minimum wage has sat at $7.25 per hour since 2009 despite the cost of living skyrocketing. Kimberly Casamento recently began a TikTok series walking viewers through recipes from a cookbook that was focused on affordable meals published in 2009. The New Jersey-based digital media manager said she's found costs for what were then considered low-budget meals ballooning between about 100% and 150%. In addition to sharing the price changes, the 33-year-old gives viewers some tips on how to keep costs down. \"Every aspect of life is so expensive that it's hard for anybody to survive,\" Casamento said. \"If you can cut the cost of your meal by $5, then that's a win.\"\n\n'A very human thing'\n\nThis type of communal knowledge-sharing is common during times of economic belt tightening, according to Megan Way, an associate professor at Babson College who studies family and intergenerational economics. While conversations about how to slash costs or to make meals stretch typically took place among neighbors in the late 2000s, Way said it makes sense that they would now play out in the digital square with the rise of social media. \"It's a very human thing to reach out to others when things are feeling uncertain and try to gain on their experience,\" Way said. \"It can really make a difference for feeling like you're moving forward a little prepared. One of the worst things for an economy is absolute fear.\"\n\nWay said that Americans are quick to look back to the Great Recession for a guide because that downturn was so shocking and widely felt. However, she said there's key differences between that economic situation and what the U.S. is facing today, such as the absence of bad debt that sparked the housing market's crash. Still, she said there's broad uncertainty felt today on several fronts \u2014 be it tied to the economy, geopolitics or domestic policy priorities like slashing the federal workforce or limiting immigration. That can reignite the feeling of unpredictability about what the future will bring that was paramount during the Great Recession, Way said. In 2025, it's clear that economic confidence among the average American is rapidly souring. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment recorded one of its worst readings in more than seven decades this month.\n\nWith that negative economic outlook comes rising stress. When Lukas Battle made a satirical TikTok about feeling like divorces were increasingly common around the time of the Great Recession, the 27-year-old's comments were abuzz with people talking about their parents splitting recently. (Though divorce has been seen as a cultural hallmark of the financial crisis, data shows the rate actually declined during this period.) \"There's a second round of divorces happening as we speak,\" Battle said.\n\nCultural parallels\n\nThat's one of several parallels social media users have drawn between the late aughts and today. When videos surfaced of a group dancing to Doechii's hit song \"Anxiety,\" several commenters on X reported feeling d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to when flashmob performances were common. Disney 's reboot of the animated show \"Phineas and Ferb,\" which originally premiered in the late 2000s, similarly put the era top of mind.\n\nLady Gaga performing at Coachella 2017 Getty Images | Christopher Polk", "publish_ts": 1745625600000, "source": "CNBC Economy"}

But we have the shocks, you know, and the shocks will be a dampen on GDP. It's a negative shock to demand.\" \"The net impact on inflation will depend on what countermeasures are eventually taken by Europe. Then we have to take into account the [German] fiscal push by the defense investments, by the infrastructure fund.\" \"We have seen successive movements, you know, announcement [of U.S. tariffs], and then a pause, and then some exemptions. So we have to be very attentive... Either we cut, either we pause, but we will be data dependent to the extreme.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nOn market moves: \"When we had done our projections, we anticipated that... the dollar would appreciate, the euro would depreciate. It's not what we saw.

Basically, uncertainty is like a tax without revenue.\" On the inflation impact: \"In the short run, we will have lower growth. We will probably also have lower inflation. As we also see, the euro is appreciating as energy prices have also come down. So together with the sort of negative factor uncertainty in the short run, it's crystal clear that it will accelerate the disinflation.\"\n\nwatch now\n\n\"But in the medium term, the inflation outlook is not all that clear. I think there are still these negative factors. But in the medium term, you might get retaliation. You might get the disruption of global value chains, which might also be inflationary in other parts of the world than the U.S. only. And then, of course, we have the fiscal policy coming in in Europe. So this is actually a time in which you need projections.\" On a June rate cut and market pricing for two more ECB rate cuts in 2025: \"I'm fully open minded. I think it's way too early to already take a position on June, whether it would be another cut. It will fully depend on these projections.\" \"I would need to see a more structured analysis of the impact on the inflation profile ahead of us, and only then can I say whether the market is pricing fair or whether I don't.\"\n\nRobert Holzmann, Austrian National Bank governor\n\nOn the need to wait for more data and news on tariffs: \"We have not seen this uncertainty now for years... unless the uncertainty subsides, by the right decisions, we will have to hold back a number of our decisions, and hence, we don't know yet in what direction monetary policy should be best moved.\" \"Before looking at data in detail, the question is, what kind of political decisions will be taken?

Is it that we will have retribution by high counter tariffs?\"\n\nwatch now\n\nOn the ECB's April rate cut: \"I think there's a broad consensus [on rates]. But of course, at the margin, people differ.\" \"My assessment is that at this time, it wasn't clear yet to what extent [tariff] countermeasures were being taken. Because with countermeasures in Europe, prices may have increased. Without countermeasures, quite likely the price pressure is downward. And for the time being, we don't know yet the direction.\" On the direction of interest rates: \"I think if the recent noises about an arrangement [on trade] were to be true, in this case, quite likely it is more towards the downside than the upside with regard to prices. But this can be changed with different decisions and the result of which, we may even imagine in [the] other direction.

But he said it wasn't because of the market tumult.\n\nMarkets recoiled following the release. Treasury yields initially headed lower but quickly snapped higher. The 10-year yield rose half a percentage point in just a few days, one of its quickest moves ever, as investors also ditched stocks and the U.S. dollar.\n\nIn the decree, Trump slapped 10% across-the-board duties against all U.S. imports and released a list of tariffs against dozens of other nations. The extra levies were based on trade deficits the U.S. had against the respective countries and raised fears about inflation, a potential recession and disruption of long-held trade agreements.\n\n\"I wasn't worried,\" Trump said in a Time magazine interview during which he was asked about financial market tumult after his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump denied that a strong bond market sell-off influenced his decision earlier this month to hold off on aggressive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against U.S. trading partners.\n\n\"No, it wasn't for that reason,\" Trump told Time in the interview from Tuesday that was published Friday. \"I'm doing that until we come up with the numbers that I want to come up with.

Andreas Rentz | Getty Images\n\nQuasi-governmental financial firm Fannie Mae on Wednesday announced a partnership with defense tech player Palantir to detect mortgage fraud, deepening ties between the federal government and a company that has been a big winner in the second Trump administration. Priscilla Almodovar, Fannie Mae CEO, said Wednesday at a press event that the goal is for the firm to \"identify fraud more proactively\" with the help of Palantir, starting with its multi-family housing business. An early test showed that Palantir's technology, which includes elements of artificial intelligence, could identify fraud in seconds that took human investigators two months to find, she said. Shares of Palantir have jumped more than 140% since President Donald Trump's election win in November. The technology stock has roles in both modernizing the U.S. military and helping to cut costs in government, making it a seemingly strong fit for the administration's stated priorities. CEO Alex Karp said Wednesday that the mortgage fraud detection can be done in a way that \"protects the underlying data and protects the privacy of the people submitting their forms.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Shares of Palantir have dramatically outperformed the broader stock market since the November election.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises that have been under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Financing Agency since 2008. The official names of the two enterprises are the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, respectively. FHFA director William Pulte said Wednesday the Palantir program could be expanded to Freddie Mac in the future and that the agency is also talking to Elon Musk's xAI firm about a potential partnership. \"The sky's the limit. We're not just limited to fraud. If there are ways to pull cost out of the system, we want to do it,\" Pulte said. The press release did not include a dollar amount that Fannie Mae would pay to Palantir for this service. The announcement comes as there is a push to potentially bring Fannie and Freddie out of conservatorship and re-establish them as something closer to independent companies. \"Our great Mortgage Agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, provide a vital service to our Nation by helping hardworking Americans reach the American Dream \u2014 Home Ownership,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Tuesday. \"I am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES, and I will stay strong in my position on overseeing them as President. These Agencies are now doing very well, and will help us to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The \"implicit guarantee\" mentioned by Trump refers to the idea among investors that the government won't let Fannie and Freddie default on their mortgage-backed securities. That concept is not legally binding but does help that massive market function and, in theory, lead to lower mortgage rates by reducing the perceived risk to investors in the housing market.\n\nwatch now", "publish_ts": 1748390400000, "source": "CNBC Top News"}

Market expectations have responded in kind, with futures traders now pricing in virtually no chance of a cut until the Fed's September meeting.\n\nTrade policy also has evolved since the Fed last gathered.\n\nTariffs and ongoing saber-rattling between the U.S. and China eased a few days after the central bank meeting, with both sides agreeing to drop the most onerous duties against each pending a 90-day negotiation period. That in turn helped kindle a rally on Wall Street, though bond yields continue to climb, something President Donald Trump has sought to contain.\n\nAmid the trade war and signs that inflation is slowly coming in toward the Fed's 2% target, Trump has hectored central bank officials to lower rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, though, has said the Fed won't be swayed by political interference.\n\nThe meeting also featured discussion about the Fed's five-year policy framework.\n\nWhen officials last visited their long-range policy, they devised what became known as \"flexible average inflation targeting,\" which essentially asserted that officials could allow inflation to run above their 2% target for a while in the interest of promoting more inclusive labor market gains.\n\nIn their discussion, officials noted that the strategy \"has diminished benefits in an environment with a substantial risk of large inflationary shocks\" or rates aren't near zero, where they had been in the years after the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed held interest rates near the lower boundary despite inflation surging following the Covid pandemic, forcing them into aggressive hikes later.\n\nThe minutes noted a desire for policy that is \"robust to a wide variety of economic environments.\" Officials also said they have no intention on altering the inflation goal.", "publish_ts": 1748390400000, "source": "CNBC Top News"}

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 As China tightens its grip on the global supply of key minerals, the West is working to reduce its dependence on Chinese rare earth. This includes finding alternative sources of rare earth minerals, developing technologies to reduce reliance, and recovering existing stockpiles through recycling products that are reaching the end of their shelf life. \"You cannot build a modern car without rare earths,\" said consulting firm AlixPartners, noting how Chinese companies have come to dominate the supply chain for the minerals. In September 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense invested $4.2 million in Rare Earth Salts, a startup that aims to extract the oxides from domestic recycled products such as fluorescent light bulbs. Japan's Toyota has also been investing in technologies to reduce the use of rare earth elements. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, China controlled 69% of rare earth mine production in 2024, and nearly half of the world's reserves. Analysts from AlixPartners estimate that a typical single-motor battery electric vehicle includes around 550 grams (1.21 pounds) of components containing rare earths, unlike gasoline-powered cars, which only use 140 grams of rare earths, or about 5 ounces.\n\nPretty soon, the first generation of EVs will be up for recycling themselves, creating a pool of ex-China material that will be under the control of the West. Christopher Ecclestone Principal and mining strategist at Hallgarten & Company\n\nMore than half of the new passenger cars sold in China are battery-only and hybrid-powered cars, unlike the U.S., where they are still mostly gasoline-powered. \"With slowing EV uptake (in the U.S.) and mandates to convert from ICE to EV formats receding into the future, the imperative for replacing Chinese-sourced materials in EVs is declining,\" said Christopher Ecclestone, principal and mining strategist at Hallgarten & Company. \"Pretty soon, the first generation of EVs will be up for recycling themselves, creating a pool of ex-China material that will be under the control of the West,\" he said.\n\nOnly 7.5% of new U.S. vehicle sales in the first quarter were electric, a modest increase from a year ago, according to Cox Automotive. It pointed out that around two-thirds of EVs sold in the U.S. last year were assembled locally, but manufacturers still rely on imports for the parts. \"The current, full-blown trade war with China, the world's leading supplier of EV battery materials, will distort the market even more.\"\n\nRare torque\n\nOf the 1.7 kilograms (3.74 pounds) of components containing rare earths found in a typical single-motor battery electric car, 550 grams (1.2 pounds) are rare earths. About the same amount, 510 grams, is used in hybrid-powered vehicles using lithium-ion batteries.\n\nIn early April, China announced export controls on seven rare earths. Those restrictions included terbium, 9 grams of which is typically used in a single-motor EV, AlixPartners data showed. None of the six other targeted rare earths are significantly used in cars, according to the data. But April's list is not the only one. A separate Chinese list of metal controls that took effect in December restricts exports of cerium, 50 grams of which AlixPartners said is used on average in a single-motor EV. The controls mean that Chinese companies handling the minerals must get government approval to sell them overseas. Caixin, a Chinese business news outlet, reported on May 15, just days after a U.S.-China trade truce, that three leading Chinese rare earth magnet companies have received export licenses from the commerce ministry to ship to North America and Europe. What's concerning for international business is that there are barely any alternatives to China for obtaining the rare earths. Mines can take years to get operating approval, while processing plants also take time and expertise to establish. \"Today, China controls over 90% of the global refined supply for the four magnet rare earth elements (Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb), which are used to make permanent magnets for EV motors,\" the International Energy Agency said in a statement. That refers to neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium.\n\nwatch now\n\nFor the less commonly used nickel metal hydride batteries in hybrid cars, the amount of rare earths goes up to 4.45 kilograms, or nearly 10 pounds, according to AlixPartners. That's largely because that kind of battery uses 3.5 kilograms of lanthanum. \"I estimate that around 70% of the over 200 kilograms of minerals in an EV goes through China, but it varies by vehicle and manufacturer. It's hard to put a definitive figure on it,\" said Henry Sanderson, associate fellow at The Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security.\n\nPower projection\n\nHowever, there are limits to recycling, which remains challenging, energy-intensive and time-consuming. And even if adoption of EVs in the U.S. slows, the minerals are used in far larger quantities in defense. For example, the F-35 fighter jet contains over 900 pounds of rare earths, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, based in Washington, D.C. China's rare earths restrictions also go beyond the closely watched list released on April 4.\n\nLarge rocks containing chromite, is crushed into smaller bitesize chunks, before to goes through a process to refine and extract the ore that yields chromium, a vital component of stainless steel, at the Mughulkhil mine in Logar Province, Afghanistan. Marcus Yam | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nIn the last two years, China has increased its control over a broader category of metals known as critical minerals. In the summer of 2023, China said it would restrict exports of gallium and germanium, both used in chipmaking. About a year later, it announced restrictions on antimony, used to strengthen other metals and a significant component in bullets, nuclear weapons production and lead-acid batteries. The State Council, the country's top executive body, in October released an entire policy for strengthening controls of exports, including minerals, that might have dual-use properties, or be used for military and civilian purposes.\n\n\n\nSubscribe now Weekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox", "publish_ts": 1748390400000, "source": "CNBC Top News"}

Alibaba said earlier this month its cloud revenue in the latest quarter rose by 18% year on year , while Baidu on Wednesday said its AI cloud business grew by 42% . \"At these rates of growth, cloud business is poised to become the 2nd largest business segment for both companies,\" Tycangco said. \"More importantly, cloud will become the basis for a return to heady growth days after several years of single-digit topline growth.\" Alibaba, Tencent and JD.com also reported double-digit growth in marketing revenue, which they said were bolstered by AI tools that were able to target consumers more effectively. The trend signals a fundamental change in Chinese markets. \"AI/Tech/New Economy [are] further gaining traction as equity market leaders,\" Morgan Stanley's chief China equity strategist Laura Wang said in a May 20 note. \"We believe that a new generation of equity market leaders is forming in these sectors, after a 5-year-long disruption period post market peak in early 2021,\" she said, noting how consumer and internet stocks previously led gains. Out of Morgan Stanley's 60 Chinese AI stock picks, those rated overweight, traded in Hong Kong and with expected upside of more than 50% as of May 19 are: Gushengtang \u2014 This health-care company is focused on traditional Chinese medicine, and it's training targeted AI models to create an \"AI physician assistant.\" The company said customer visits rose by 12.7% in the first quarter to 1.21 million. Bairong \u2014 This cloud-based AI services company is focused on state-owned banks and other financial services companies. The company added in its 2024 annual report that Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms use Bairong's AI model service to evaluate consumers' purchasing power. When it comes to more popular names, the Morgan Stanley analysts prefer Alibaba and Tencent over Baidu and iFlytek. They also prefer Meituan, Meitu and Trip.com over Kuaishou and JD.com. Among mainland China-listed companies, 68% mentioned AI in their 2024 annual reports, up from 43% in the first half of 2024, HSBC Qianhai Securities head of research Steven Sun, said in a May 16 report. \u201cWe also observed a slightly upward revision of 2025e consensus capex for major cloud service providers after 1Q25 results, suggesting they are still upbeat about their AI business.\u201d The information technology sector saw earnings rise by 24.7% in the first quarter from a year ago on improving AI penetration, the HSBC report said, noting it was one of the fastest-growing sectors. One of HSBC's buy-rated picks is enterprise software and cybersecurity company Sangfor, listed in Shenzhen, with a price target of 143 yuan. The firm thinks accelerating AI adoption can help drive earnings growth. Chinese-developed DeepSeek surprised global investors in late January with its ability to rival OpenAI's ChatGPT, while claiming a fraction of development cost. In the months since, several Chinese companies have also released new AI tools for generating video or 3D models. China's recent tech breakthroughs stem from the country's breadth of engineers, data and vast social media and e-commerce ecosystem, the Morgan Stanley analysts said, noting how government support can enable faster tech adoption. \"We continue to believe that such structural improvement would be less susceptible to the ongoing tariff dispute and the overall macro challenges,\" the report said. \u201cThis is important in attracting foreign investors to build long-term commitments of allocation, as they discover a decent number of companies that are distinctive and exclusively available in China, despite the broad macro slowdown.\u201d Listed Chinese stocks generate the majority of their revenue domestically, with only 3% U.S. revenue exposure, the analysts said. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "publish_ts": 1748131200000, "source": "CNBC Top News"}

Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images\n\nThere's a stark contrast between the effects on high earners and those on low-income households in a sprawling legislative package House Republicans passed Thursday. The bulk of the financial benefits in the legislation \u2014 called the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" \u2014 would flow to the wealthiest Americans, courtesy of tax-cutting measures such as those for business owners, investors and homeowners in high-tax areas, experts said. However, low earners would be worse off, they said. That's largely because Republicans partially offset those tax cuts \u2014 estimated to cost about $4 trillion or more \u2014 with reductions to social safety net programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, formerly known as food stamps. The tax and spending package now heads to the Senate, where it may face further changes.\n\n'It skews pretty heavily toward the wealthy'\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal scorekeeper, estimates income for the bottom 10% of households would fall by 2% in 2027 and by 4% in 2033 as a result of the bill's changes. By contrast, those in the top 10% would get an income boost from the legislation: 4% in 2027 and 2% in 2033, CBO found.\n\nwatch now\n\nA Yale Budget Lab analysis found a similar dynamic. The bottom 20% of households \u2014 who make less than $14,000 a year \u2014 would see their annual incomes fall about $800 in 2027, on average, Yale estimates. The top 20% \u2014 who earn over $128,000 a year \u2014 would see theirs grow by $9,700, on average, in 2027. The top 1% would gain $63,000. The Yale and CBO analyses don't account for last-minute changes to the House legislation, including stricter work requirements for Medicaid. \"It skews pretty heavily toward the wealthy,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Biden administration. The legislation compounds the regressive nature of the Trump administration's recent tariff policies, economists said. \"If you incorporated the [Trump administration's] hike in tariffs, this would be even more skewed against lower- and working-class families,\" Tedeschi said.\n\nMost tax cuts in the bill go to top-earning households\n\nThere are several ways the House bill skews toward the wealthiest Americans, experts said. Among them are more valuable tax breaks tied to business income, state and local taxes and the estate tax, experts said. These tax breaks disproportionately flow to high earners, experts said. For example, the bottom 80% of earners would see no benefit from the House proposal to raise the SALT cap to $40,000 from the current $10,000, according to the Tax Foundation. More from Personal Finance:\n\nTax bill includes $1,000 baby bonus in 'Trump Accounts'\n\nHouse bill boosts maximum child tax credit to $2,500\n\nFood stamps face 'biggest cut in the program's history' The bill also preserves a lower top tax rate, at 37%, set by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which would have expired at the end of the year. It kept a tax break intact that allows investors to shield their capital gains from tax by funneling money into \"opportunity zones.\" Trump's 2017 tax law created that tax break, with the aim of incentivizing investment in lower-income areas designated by state governors. Taxpayers with capital gains are \"highly concentrated\" among the wealthy, according to the Tax Policy Center. All told, 60% of the bill's tax cuts would go to the top 20% of households and more than a third would go to those making $460,000 or more, according to the Tax Policy Center. \"The variation among income groups is striking,\" the analysis said.\n\nWhy many low earners are worse off\n\nThat said, more than 8 in 10 households overall would get a tax cut in 2026 if the bill is enacted, the Tax Policy Center found. Lower earners stand to benefit from provisions including a higher standard deduction and temporarily enhanced child tax credit, and tax breaks tied to tip income and car loan interest, for example, experts said. However, some of those benefits may not be as valuable as they seem at first glance, experts said. For example, roughly one-third of tipped workers don't pay federal income tax, Tedeschi said. They wouldn't benefit from the proposed tax break on tips \u2014 it's structured as a tax deduction, which doesn't benefit households without tax liability, he said.\n\nwatch now\n\nMeanwhile, lower-income households, which rely more on federal safety net programs, would see cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and benefits linked to student loans and Affordable Care Act premiums, said Kent Smetters, an economist and faculty director at the Penn Wharton Budget Model. The House bill would, for example, impose work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP beneficiaries. Total federal spending on those programs would fall by about $700 billion and $267 billion, respectively, through 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office analysis. That said, \"if you are low income and don't get SNAP, Medicaid or ACA premium support, you will be slightly better off,\" Smetters said.\n\nSome high earners would pay more in tax", "publish_ts": 1747958400000, "source": "CNBC Top News"}

I'm a doctor, and I'm looking at the patient, and I've said, you're having this accumulation, and I can tell you that this is very, very serious, and I can't tell you the exact time. I would say that if we're really looking over the next three years, to give or take a year or two, that we're in that type of a critical, critical situation.\"\n\nThe founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds, has warned about the ballooning U.S. deficit for years. Recently, investors have begun demanding lower prices to buy the bonds that cover the government's massive budget deficits, pushing up yields on the debt. Rising worries about the fiscal situation last week triggered a high-profile credit rating downgrade from Moody's.\n\nThe yield on the 30-year Treasury yield on Thursday traded at levels not seen since 2023, around 5.14%.\n\nRising financing costs along with continued spending growth and declining tax receipts have combined to send deficits spiraling, pushing the national debt past the $36 trillion mark.

Those trends were expected to fuel an even stronger M&A comeback in 2025, after last year's moderate recovery from a slow 2023.\n\nThis year's appetite for dealmaking came back quickly after Trump suspended his highest tariffs and market jitters took a backseat. If borrowing costs remain in check, many expect activity could be brisk.\n\n\"More clarity on trade policy and rebounding equities markets have set the stage for continued M&A, even in sectors hit especially hard by tariffs,\" Kevin Ketcham, a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Mergermarket, told CNBC.\n\nThe total value of U.S. deals jumped to more than $227 billion in March, which saw 586 deals, before suddenly slowing down in April to roughly 650 deals worth about $134 billion, according to data compiled by Mergermarket.\n\nSo far this month, activity is rebounding and the average deal has been larger.

Moving factory work back to the U.S would mean a significant increase in labor costs, which many companies simply could not afford, the Wall Street bank said. Even if they are willing to absorb or pass the higher prices onto consumers, companies are challenged by an already tight labor market for production workers. \"A meaningful increase in factory jobs does not appear likely in the foreseeable future, in our view,\" Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, said in a research report. \"Higher prices and policy uncertainty may weigh on firms' ability and willingness to expand payrolls.\" The Trump administration believes a reshoring boom is on the horizon in the wake of a trade war that brings the effective tariff rate facing importers to the highest level since the 1940s, even accounting for the recent pause on some of the heaviest duties. Trump has also promised tax cuts for companies that bring back manufacturing to the U.S. There have been a few of high-profile announcements from the tech sector , including Nvidia's plans for a supercomputer plant in the U.S. and Apple's commitment to invest $500 billion at home.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.\n\n\"Apple is still number one,\" Lei said in Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation.

He revealed that the company started developing chips in 2014 and unveiled one in 2017, before temporarily suspending such research.\n\nLast spring, Xiaomi launched its first electric car, the SU7 sedan, with a price $4,000 below that of Tesla's Model 3 at the time.
